AB  - In millions of years, spiders have optimized their venoms in order to assure 
      successful prey capture and defence against predators. Spider venoms have become 
      unique cocktails of biological active components enabling potentially interesting 
      application for drug discovery or for agricultural purposes. The venom of Phoneutria 
      nigriventer has been studied for over 60 years. This spider is responsible for a 
      high number of envenomations with severe clinical manifestations in humans, which 
      necessitates a comprehensive knowledge of its venom composition. With over 40 
      different neurotoxic peptides characterized so far and still many more awaiting 
      identification, this venom is undoubtedly a pharmacological treasure. This review 
      provides an overview of the Phoneutria nigriventer toxins known today and describes 
      their mechanism of action at a molecular level. We critically discuss the potential 
      of the Phoneutria nigriventer venom peptides as pharmaceutical tools or lead 
      compounds for drug development.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer venom (PNV) is a complex mixture of toxins exerting multiple 
      pharmacological effects that ultimately result in severe local pain at the site of 
      the bite. It has been proposed that the PNV-induced pain is mediated by both 
      peripheral and central mechanisms. The nociception triggered by PNV is peripherally 
      mediated by the activation of B(2), 5-HT(4), NMDA, AMPA, NK(1), and NK(2) receptors, 
      as well as TTXS-Na(+), ASIC, and TRPV1 channels. The activation of tachykinin, 
      glutamate and CGRP receptors along with the production of inflammatory mediators 
      are, at least partially, responsible for the central component of pain. Despite its 
      well established pro-nociceptive properties, PNV contains some toxins with 
      antinociceptive activity, which have been studied in the last few years. The toxins 
      ω-CNTX-Pn4a, ω-CNTX-Pn2a, ω-CNTX-Pn3a, κ-CNTX-Pn1a, U(7)-CNTX-Pn1a, δ-CNTX-Pn1a, and 
      Γ-CNTX-Pn1a from PNV, as well as the semi-synthetic peptide PnPP-19 have been tested 
      in different experimental models of pain showing consistent antinociceptive 
      properties. This review aims to discuss the pro- and antinociceptive actions of PNV 
      and its toxins, highlighting possible mechanisms involved in these apparently 
      dualistic properties.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer venom: a cocktail of toxins that affect ion channels.
PG  - 579-88
AB  - 1. We review the pharmacological actions of toxins present in the venom of the 
      aggressive spider Phoneutria nigriventer. 2. This venom is rich in toxins that 
      affect ion channels and neurotransmitter release. Voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and 
      potassium channels have been described as the main targets of these toxins. 3. In 
      addition to these classical actions Phoneutria toxins have also been shown to affect 
      glutamate transporter. 4. It is expected that molecular genetics in addition to 
      biochemical, biophysical and pharmacological approaches will help to further define 
      Phoneutria toxins and their mechanisms of action in the near future.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer is one of the largest existing true spiders and one of the 
      few considered medically relevant. Its venom contains several neurotoxic peptides 
      that act on different ion channels and chemical receptors of vertebrates and 
      invertebrates. Some of these venom toxins have been shown as promising models for 
      pharmaceutical or biotechnological use. However, the large diversity and the 
      predominance of low molecular weight toxins in this venom have hampered the 
      identification and deep investigation of the less abundant toxins and the proteins 
      with high molecular weight. Here, we combined conventional and next-generation cDNA 
      sequencing with Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT), to 
      obtain an in-depth panorama of the composition of P. nigriventer spider venom. The 
      results from these three approaches showed that cysteine-rich peptide toxins are the 
      most abundant components in this venom and most of them contain the Inhibitor 
      Cysteine Knot (ICK) structural motif. Ninety-eight sequences corresponding to 
      cysteine-rich peptide toxins were identified by the three methodologies and many of 
      them were considered as putative novel toxins, due to the low similarity to 
      previously described toxins. Furthermore, using next-generation sequencing we 
      identified families of several other classes of toxins, including CAPs (Cysteine 
      Rich Secretory Protein-CRiSP, antigen 5 and Pathogenesis-Related 1-PR-1), serine 
      proteinases, TCTPs (translationally controlled tumor proteins), proteinase 
      inhibitors, metalloproteinases and hyaluronidases, which have been poorly described 
      for this venom. This study provides an overview of the molecular diversity of P. 
      nigriventer venom, revealing several novel components and providing a better basis 
      to understand its toxicity and pharmacological activities.

AB  - The mechanisms of cancer involve changes in multiple biological pathways. 
      Multitarget molecules, which are components of animal venoms, are therefore a 
      potential strategy for treating tumors. The objective of this study was to screen 
      the effects of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PnV) on tumor cell lines. 
      Cultured human glioma (NG97), glioblastoma (U-251) and cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) 
      cells, and nontumor mouse fibroblasts (L929) were treated with low (14 µg/ml) and 
      high (280 µg/ml) concentrations of PnV, and analyzed through assays for cell 
      viability (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue), proliferation (carboxyfluorescein 
      succinimidyl ester), death (annexin V/propidium iodide [Pi]), the cell cycle (Pi), 
      and migration (wound healing and transwell assay). The venom decreased the viability 
      of U-251 cells, primarily by inducing cell death, and reduced the viability of NG97 
      cells, primarily by inhibiting the cell cycle. The migration of all the tumor cell 
      lines was delayed when treated with venom. The venom significantly affected all the 
      tumor cell lines studied, with no cytotoxic effect on normal cells (L929), although 
      the nonglial tumor cell (HeLa) was less sensitive to PnV. The results of the current 
      study suggest that PnV may be composed of peptides that are highly specific for the 
      multiple targets involved in the hallmarks of cancer. Experiments are underway to 
      identify these molecules.

      side effects. Thus, it is proposed to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of the 
      recombinant CTK 01512-2 peptide that is derived from the venom of the Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider, as a future new therapeutical option. The neuropathic pain was 
      surgically induced by avulsion of the upper brachial plexus trunk in groups of male 
      Wistar rats and after 17 days, they were treated intrathecally with morphine, 
      ziconotide, and CTK 01512-2. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate mechanical 
      and thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, the functional activity of the front paw, 
      and exploratory locomotion after the treatments. The peripheral blood samples were 
      collected 6 h after the treatments and a comet assay was performed. The spinal cord 
      was removed for the lipoperoxidation dosing of the membranes. The cerebrospinal 
      fluid was analyzed for the dosage of glutamate. The recombinant peptide showed an 
      antinociceptive effect when compared to the other drugs, without affecting the 
      locomotor activity of the animals. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, as well as 
      cold allodynia, were reduced in the first hours of treatment. The levels of 
      glutamate and the damage by membrane lipoperoxidation were shown to be improved, and 
      genotoxicity was not demonstrated. In a scenario of therapeutical failures in the 
      treatment of this type of pain, CTK 01512-2 was shown as a new effective alternative 
      protocol. However, further testing is required to determine pharmacokinetics.

AB  - Here we present a proteomic characterization of Phoneutria nigriventer venom. A 
      shotgun proteomic approach allowed the identification, for the first time, of 
      O-glycosyl hydrolases (chitinases) in P. nigriventer venom. The electrophoretic 
      profiles under nonreducing and reducing conditions, and protein identification by 
      mass spectrometry, indicated the presence of oligomeric toxin structures in the 
      venom. Complementary proteomic approaches allowed for a qualitative and 
      semi-quantitative profiling of P. nigriventer venom complexity, expanding its known 
      venom proteome diversity.

AB  - Bites from genus Phoneutria (Ctenidae, Araneomorpha) are the second most frequent 
      source of spider accidents in Southeast Brazil. Severe envenoming from Phoneutria 
      nigriventer produces vision disturbance, tremor and convulsion, suggesting that the 
      CNS is involved; however, the mechanisms by which P. nigriventer venom (PNV) affects 
      the CNS remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate whether PNV 
      directly impairs astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were exposed to PNV, and 
      intracellular Ca(2+) release and signaling were measured (Fura-2/AM), 
      Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) involvement were investigated, 
      actin filaments were stained (Alexa™ 488-conjugated phalloidin probe), the 
      G-actin/F-actin ratio was determined, and the expression level of connexin 43 (Cx43) 
      was assessed. Incubation in Ca(2+)-free buffer did not change the Ca(2+) responses. 
      However, pre-incubation in thapsigargin/caffeine completely abolished these 
      responses, suggesting that PNV-evoked Ca(2+) transients were from intracellular 
      Ca(2+) stores. Pretreatment with a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase antagonist (ouabain) or a TLR4 
      antagonist (LPS-RS) decreased or increased the Ca(2+)-evoked transients, 
      respectively. Astrocytes showed altered actin filament structure after PNV exposure. 
      PNV treatment increased the expression levels of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Cx43 but 
      decreased those of TLR4. The present results suggest that PNV directly affects 
      astrocytes. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase may thus represent a more specific drug target for 
      controlling the neurotoxicity of PNV.

TI  - The effect of Phoneutria nigriventer (armed spider) venom on arterial blood pressure 
      of anaesthetised rats.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - The changes induced in the mean arterial blood pressure of anaesthetised rats 
      following the administration of armed spider (Phoneutria nigriventer) venom have 
      been investigated. The intravenous injection of Phoneutria nigriventer venom (0.1 
      mg/kg) evoked a brief and reversible decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure 
      whereas a higher dose of venom (0.3 mg/kg) caused a biphasic response characterized 
      by a short-lasting hypotension followed by a sustained and prolonged hypertension 
      (40-50 min). These changes were accompanied by tachycardia, salivation, 
      fasciculations, defecation and respiratory disturbances. Pretreatment of the animals 
      with atropine (10 mg/kg), propranolol (100 mg/kg), phenoxybenzamine (100 mg/kg) and 
      indomethacin (4 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the mean arterial blood pressure 
      changes induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom. Similarly, the bradykinin B2 
      receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,DTic7,Oic8]-bradykinin) (0.6 mg/kg), 
      the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 
      (3-(4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno-(3,2f) (1,2,4)-triazolo-(4,3-a) 
      (1,4)-diazepine-2-yl)-(4-morpholinyl)-1-propanone) (20 mg/kg), the tachykinin NK1 
      receptor antagonist SR 140333 
      ((S)1-(2-[3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(3-iso-propoxyphenyl acetyl) piperidin-3-yl] 
      ethyl)-4-phenyl-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2] octane, chloride) (0.5 mg/kg), the tachykinin 
      NK2 receptor antagonist SR 48968 
      ((S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophen yl) 
      butyl]benzamide) (0.5 mg/kg) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N 
      omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the mean 
      arterial blood pressure changes induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom. The 
      increase in the blood pressure induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom was also not 
      significantly affected by either the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan (10 
      mg/kg) or the endothelin ETA receptor antagonist FR 139317 
      ((R)2-[(R)-2-[[1-(hexahydro-1H-azepinyl]carbonyl]amino-4-methyl- 
      pentanoyl]amino-3-[3-(1-methyl-1H-indoyl)]propionyl] amino-3-(2-pyridyl) propionic 
      acid) (30 mg/kg). The ATP-dependent K+ channel antagonist glibenclamide (50 mg/kg) 
      reduced by 40% the hypotension induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom without 
      affecting the hypertensive response. Pretreatment of the animals with L-type Ca2+ 
      channel antagonists such as verapamil (10-100 micrograms/kg/min), diltiazem (40-120 
      micrograms/kg/min) and nifedipine (0.3-10 mg/kg) markedly attenuated the 
      hypertension induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom. Verapamil (30 
      micrograms/kg/min) and diltiazem (120 micrograms/kg/min) also promptly reversed the 
      established hypertension induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom when infused 8 min 
      after venom injection. Our results indicate that the brief decrease of blood 
      pressure induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom is partially due to ATP-dependent 
      K+ channel activation. The prolonged hypertension seems to result from direct Ca2+ 
      entry into vascular and/or cardiac muscles.

TI  - Mechanisms involved in the nociception triggered by the venom of the armed spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - e2198
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002198 [doi]
LID - e2198
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of accidental spider bites in Brazil is growing, and 
      poisoning due to bites from the spider genus Phoneutria nigriventer is the second 
      most frequent source of such accidents. Intense local pain is the major symptom 
      reported after bites of P. nigriventer, although the mechanisms involved are still 
      poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms 
      involved in nociception triggered by the venom of Phoneutria nigriventer (PNV). 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty microliters of PNV or PBS was injected into 
      the mouse paw (intraplantar, i.pl.). The time spent licking the injected paw was 
      considered indicative of the level of nociception. I.pl. injection of PNV produced 
      spontaneous nociception, which was reduced by arachnid antivenin (ArAv), local 
      anaesthetics, opioids, acetaminophen and dipyrone, but not indomethacin. Boiling or 
      dialysing the venom reduced the nociception induced by the venom. PNV-induced 
      nociception is not dependent on glutamate or histamine receptors or on mast cell 
      degranulation, but it is mediated by the stimulation of sensory fibres that contain 
      serotonin 4 (5-HT4) and vanilloid receptors (TRPV1). We detected a kallikrein-like 
      kinin-generating enzyme activity in tissue treated with PNV, which also contributes 
      to nociception. Inhibition of enzymatic activity or administration of a receptor 
      antagonist for kinin B2 was able to inhibit the nociception induced by PNV. PNV 
      nociception was also reduced by the blockade of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) 
      channels, acid-sensitive ion channels (ASIC) and TRPV1 receptors. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that both low- and high-molecular-weight 
      toxins of PNV produce spontaneous nociception through direct or indirect action of 
      kinin B2, TRPV1, 5-HT4 or ASIC receptors and voltage-dependent sodium channels 
      present in sensory neurons but not in mast cells. Understanding the mechanisms 
      involved in nociception caused by PNV are of interest not only for better treating 
      poisoning by P. nigriventer but also appreciating the diversity of targets triggered 
      by PNV toxins.

AB  - An important transcellular transport mechanism in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      involves caveolae, which are specialized delta-shaped domains of the endothelial 
      plasma membrane that are rich in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and the scaffolding 
      protein Caveolina-1 (Cav-1). In this work, we investigated whether the increase in 
      endocytosis and transendothelial vesicular trafficking in rat cerebellum after 
      blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb) induced by Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom 
      (PNV) was mediated by caveolae. The expression of Cav-1, phosphorylated Cav-1 
      (pCav-1), dynamin-2 (Dyn2), Src kinase family (SKF) and matrix-metalloproteinase-9 
      (MMP9), proteins involved in caveolar dynamics and BBB opening, was investigated. 
      Immunofluorescence, western blotting (WB) and transmission electron microscopy were 
      used to assess changes at 1, 2, 5, 24 and 72h post-venom. WB showed upregulation of 
      Cav-1, Dyn2 and MMP9 at 1, 5 and 72h (corresponding, respectively, to intervals when 
      intoxication was most evident, when signs of recovery were present, and when no 
      intoxication was detectable). In contrast, pCav-1 and SKF, which are essential for 
      internalization and transport, decreased when Cav-1 and Dyn2, proteins essential for 
      caveolar formation, were increased. Overall, these changes indicated that vesicular 
      trafficking across the endothelium (high pCav/SKF levels) coincided with lower 
      numbers of caveolae (Cav-1/Dyn2 downregulation) and lower expression of MMP9. Thus, 
      the internalization (disassembly) of caveolae alternates with caveolar neoformation 
      (assembly), resulting in changes in caveolar density in the endothelium membrane. 
      These caveolar dynamics imply tensional mechanical stress that is important in 
      triggering key signaling mechanisms. We conclude that PNV-induced breakdown of 
      transcellular transport in the BBB is caused by an increase in caveolae-mediated 
      endocytosis; this effect was correlated with the progression of temporal signs of 
      envenoming. Caveolar dynamics are probably involved in shear stress and BBBb 
      regulatory mechanisms in this experimental model.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom has been studied for more than 40 years and 
      several components with pharmacological potential have been described in it. 
      However, studies on venoms from other species of the Phoneutria genus are scarce. In 
      this work, a conventional cDNA library from the species Phoneutria pertyi venom 
      glands was constructed, aiming to identify novel putative cysteine-rich peptide 
      toxins for the genus Phoneutria. 296 unique sequences were identified and 51 
      sequences corresponded to putative cysteine-rich peptide toxins. Besides 
      cysteine-rich peptide toxins, other putative venom components such as protease 
      inhibitors, defensins and serine proteinases were identified. Furthermore, by manual 
      curation of the sequences with no match at UniProt, we were able to identify 
      glycine-rich proteins (GRP), a class of venom component never described in 
      Phoneutria genus. This work describes the first complete sequences of toxins from 
      the venom of P. pertyi and reveals that, despite most of the retrieved toxins show a 
      high identity to toxins identified in Phoneutria genus, novel putative toxins 
      remains to be described.

TI  - Structural analysis of the venom glands of the armed spider Phoneutria nigriventer

AB  - Spiders belonging to the genus Phoneutria (Perty, 1833), most commonly known as 
      'armed' spiders, are among the most dangerous species in Brazil due to high toxicity 
      of their venom, associated with their habit of invading domestic or specific areas 
      such as banana plantations. The venom of Phoneutria spiders is secreted by a pair of 
      venom glands located inside their cephalothoraxes and connected to the chelicerae by 
      two independent ducts. In the present study, the microanatomy and histological 
      structure of the venom glands of Phoneutria nigriventer (Keyserling, 1891) were 
      examined in detail by histochemical and conventional stains with laser confocal, 
      scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The analysis confirmed the 
      bulbous-shaped organ previously observed by others. The venom glands of P. 
      nigriventer are covered externally by a double layer of striated muscles, which are 
      arranged in a spiral fashion. This disposition of the external muscle fibers might 
      provide the contraction movement of the venom gland to release their contents during 
      a sting aggression. The presence of pore-like openings between the muscle fibers 
      that cover the venom glands of P. nigriventer was considered quite remarkable. The 
      presence of axon-like structures between the muscle fibers seen in the gland surface 
      was also quite remarkable. The secretory epithelium of P. nigriventer invaginates 
      into the gland lumen, contributing to the increase of the secretory surface area and 
      also accommodating a higher number of secretory cells. Our observation of 
      histological sections and SEM showed that the secretory cells in the venom gland of 
      P. nigriventer form complex structures, secretory units, which originate at the base 
      near the muscular layer and that extend into the central area until the gland lumen. 
      Our study also identified a possible holocrine secretory mechanism of P. nigriventer 
      venom gland, at least in the first venom milking, since we were able to see nuclei 
      stained on confocal laser microscopy. However, our observation cannot disregard 
      other possible types of secretory pathways in subsequent milkings, since we found no 
      nuclei in the second and in the third venom secretions.

TI  - Primary culture of venom glands from the Brazilian armed spider, Phoneutria 
      nigriventer (Araneae, Ctenidae).
PG  - 428-34
AB  - Phoneutria spider venoms are a rich source of bioactive components. The limited 
      amounts of crude material available, however, can be considered as a major hindrance 
      for a faster development in the field. In the present study, we attempted to 
      establish primary cultures of venom glands of Phoneutria nigriventer as an 
      alternative, in vitro source of venom. Three different developmental stages were 
      tried as starting materials: whole embryo (inside the cocoon), nymph (early after 
      cocoon hatching) and young adult (1 year after cocoon hatching). The embryonic cells 
      remained in suspension in the primary cultures, with no signs of adhesion or 
      differentiation, for about 6 months. Nevertheless, this culture was useful for the 
      first chromosome C-banding of Phoneutria. An average of 29+/-1 acrocentric 
      chromosomes were found. Striated muscle cells were the only kind of cells in the 
      culture of venom glands from Phoneutria nymphs. The most promising results were 
      achieved with 1-year-old specimens. Besides muscle, adherent epithelial cells were 
      also obtained in culture. Although these cells remained in culture for a short time 
      (up to 48 h) immunochemical analysis of the culture supernatant evidenced the 
      presence of Phoneutria venom components. This can be considered as a first step 
      toward the functional cultures of venom glands of Phoneutria spiders.

TI  - Activation by Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom of autonomic nerve fibers in the 
      isolated rat heart.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - In the isolated rat heart, Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (10-100 microg) 
      produced a dose-dependent and reversible rise in left ventricular developed 
      pressure. A low dose (10 microg) of venom induced a short-lasting, positive 
      inotropic effect (P < 0.05) with no change in heart rate or coronary flow. At a dose 
      of 50 microg, the venom caused significant positive inotropic and chronotropic 
      responses associated with occasional ventricular arrhythmia, whereas coronary flow 
      was not significantly affected within 10 min after venom administration. The highest 
      dose of venom (100 microg) caused bradycardia, transient cardiac arrest, rhythm 
      disturbances and an increase in end diastolic pressure followed by a reduction in 
      coronary flow. Hearts treated with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 
      propranolol (3 microM) and the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP-20712A 
      (10 microM) were protected against all the cardiac actions of the venom. The 
      selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine (10 microM) slightly reduced the 
      cardiac response to 50 microg, but not to 100 microg of venom. Butoxamine also 
      prevented the reduction in coronary flow induced by 100 microg of venom. Hearts from 
      reserpine-treated rats (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1), i.p., for 2 days) showed a marked 
      decrease in all venom (< or = 100 microg)-induced cardiac responses. The muscarinic 
      receptor antagonist atropine (1 microM) slightly potentiated the response to 50 
      microg of venom but had little or no effect on the responses to 100 microg of venom. 
      The cardiac responses to venom (50-100 microg) were unaltered in hearts from rats 
      treated with 8-methyl N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide (capsaicin; 50 mg/kg, s.c.). These 
      findings indicate that P. nigriventer venom releases norepinephrine from cardiac 
      sympathetic nerve endings and this may explain the observed increase in contractile 
      force and heart rate.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom induces oedema in rat skin by activation of 
      capsaicin sensitive sensory nerves.
PG  - 223-6
AB  - Phoneeutria nigriventer venom induces oedema formation when injected in the rat 
      dorsal skin and such oedema is, in part, dependent on the stimulation of tachykinin 
      NK1 receptors. This study investigated whether Phoneutria nigriventer venom acts 
      directly on tachykinin NK1 receptors, or indirectly to activate sensory neurones 
      which in turn release a tachykinin NK1 receptor agonist. The plasma extravasation 
      induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom (1-10 microg/site) in neonatally capsaicin 
      (8-methyl N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide)-pretreated rats was substantially attenuated (P < 
      0.05) but the response to either the tachykinin NK1 receptor agonist GR73632 
      ((deltaAva[L-Pro9, N-MeLeu10] substance P-(7-11) 30 pmol/site) or bradykinin (0.3-3 
      nmol/site) was not affected. These results indicate that Phoneutria nigriventer 
      venom stimulates sensory nerves indirectly. The lack of effect of 
      capsaicin-pretreatment on the GR73632 and bradykinin responses indicated that the 
      tachykinin NK1 and bradykinin B2 receptors remained functional. There was no 
      evidence to suggest that Phoneutria nigriventer venom contains a tachykinin NK1 
      receptor agonist.

TI  - Activation by Phoneutria nigriventer (armed spider) venom of tissue 
      kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in rabbit skin in vivo.
PG  - 539-43
AB  - 1. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms by which venom 
      from Phoneutria nigriventer spider induces increases in vascular permeability in 
      rabbit skin. 2. Local oedema formation, in response to intradermally-injected 
      agents, was measured in male New Zealand white rabbits as the local accumulation of 
      i.v. injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin into skin sites. 3. Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom (10-30 micrograms/site) increased vascular permeability, which was 
      inhibited by trasylol (10 micrograms/site) and the bradykinin B2 receptor 
      antagonists D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-BK (3 nmol/site) and Hoe 140 (0.3 nmol/site). 
      In addition, the oedema induced by the venom was potentiated by the kinase II 
      inhibitor, captopril (1 nmol/site). The lipoxygenase inhibitor, BWA4C (10 nmol/site) 
      and the PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (100 nmol/site) had no effect on the venom-induced 
      increase in vascular permeability. 4. Incubation of rabbit plasma with Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom in vitro did not cause bradykinin formation. Further, the plasma 
      kallikrein inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 micrograms/site), had no effect 
      on the venom-induced increase in vascular permeability in rabbit skin. 5. These 
      results indicate that the oedema produced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom is 
      dependent on the activation of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system.

AB  - In the last decades, main advances were achieved in the identification, structural 
      and pharmacological characterization of Phoneutria nigriventer toxins. However, 
      studies on the venom-producing apparatus are rare. Presently, we applied 
      immunolabeling to historesin-embedded cross-sections of P. nigriventer venom glands. 
      Toxins and toxin-secreting cells were successfully located in situ, using laser 
      confocal scanning microscopy. The methodological strategy was successful and may be 
      applied in future studies on venom glands and other secreting tissues, in general.

AB  - Although the spiders of the genus Phoneutria cause envenomation and their presence 
      has been described in several provinces of the north of Argentina, they are not as 
      common as other spiders of sanitary importance. In the present work, we studied the 
      toxicity of samples of venom of Phoneutria spiders from the provinces of Misiones 
      (where severe envenomation and deaths by Phoneutria have been recorded) and Jujuy 
      (where no deaths have been recorded and severe envenomations are not frequent). To 
      this end, we assessed the lethal potency in mice and guinea pigs and the 
      histopathological alterations caused by both venoms, as well as the neutralization 
      by the commonly used therapeutic antivenom produced by the Butantan Institute in 
      Brazil and by an experimental antivenom developed with venom of P. nigriventer from 
      Misiones. There were no differences in the lethality of the venoms of spiders from 
      both regions. Post mortem examination showed that the heart and lungs were the most 
      affected organs, while important pulmonary edema was seen macroscopically. 
      Histological analysis showed edema, atelectasis, emphysema and cardiac lesion in 
      both experimental models. The antivenoms assayed showed good neutralization of the 
      venoms in the two experimental models. Despite the different geographic origins, the 
      venoms showed similar toxicity and both the experimental antivenom and therapeutic 
      antivenmos were able to neutralize the venoms of Argentinean P. nigriventer.

TI  - Acute Toxicity of the Recombinant and Native Phα1β Toxin: New Analgesic from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer Spider Venom.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10120531 [doi]
LID - 531
AB  - Phα1β, a purified peptide from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, and 
      its recombinant form CTK 01512-2 are voltage-dependent calcium channel (Ca(V)) 
      blockers of types N, R, P/Q, and L with a preference for type N. These peptides show 
      analgesic action in different pain models in rats. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the acute intrathecal toxicity of the native and recombinant Phα1β toxin in 
      Wistar rats. Clinical signs, serum biochemistry, organ weight, and histopathological 
      alterations were evaluated in male and/or female rats. Dyspnea was observed in 
      males, hyporesponsiveness in females, and Straub tail and tremors in both genders. 
      There were no significant differences in male organ weight, although significant 
      differences in the female relative weight of the adrenal glands and spleen have been 
      observed; these values are within the normal range. Serum biochemical data revealed 
      a significant reduction within the physiological limits of species related to urea, 
      ALT, AST, and FA. Hepatic and renal congestion were observed for toxin groups. In 
      renal tissue, glomerular infiltrates were observed with increased glomerular space. 
      These histological alterations were presented in focal areas and in mild degree. 
      Therefore, Phα1β and CTK 01512-2 presented a good safety profile with transient 
      toxicity clinical signals in doses higher than used to obtain the analgesic effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: PnPa11 and PnPa13 are synthetic peptides derived from Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom, which display antinociceptive and neuroprotective 
      properties. In this work, we evaluated the safety of intravitreal use and the 
      neuroprotective effect of these peptides. METHODS: The cytotoxicity and the 
      antiangiogenic activity of these peptides were evaluated by the sulforhodamine-B 
      method and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, respectively. The in vivo 
      safety was analyzed in Wistar rats that were intravitreally injected with different 
      doses (0.50; 1.25; 2.50; 3.75 and 5.00 µg/mL) of these peptides (right eye, n = 6). 
      The retinal function was assessed by electroretinography exams (ERG), intraocular 
      pressure (IOP), and histological analyzes. In order to investigate the 
      neuroprotective effect, Wistar rats received intravitreal injections (right eye, n = 
      6) of peptides at 1.25 µg/mL and then were exposed to blue LED light. In addition, 
      the visual function and the retinal microstructure were verified. RESULTS: 
      Cytotoxicity analyses demonstrated that the peptides did not present any toxicity 
      over ARPE-19 (adult retinal pigmented epithelial) cell line and the antiangiogenic 
      study highlighted that the peptides promoted the reduction of blood vessels. The 
      intravitreal injection did not cause major changes, neither induced any irreversible 
      damage. In the retinal degeneration assay, the ERG records demonstrated that the 
      prior treatment with PnPa11 and PnPa13 protected the retina from damage. 
      Morphological analyses confirmed the ERG findings. Immunoblotting analyses revealed 
      that PnPa11 increased Erk1/2, NR2A, and NR2B retinal expression after the light 
      stress model, but did not cause Akt1 activation, while PnPa13 prevented Erk1/2 and 
      Akt1 dephosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: The intraocular administration of these 
      peptides was well tolerated and presented protective activity against retinal 
      degeneration, suggesting the potential use of these peptides as neuroprotectors in 
      the ophthalmological field.

TI  - Sandwich-ELISA detection of venom antigens in envenoming by Phoneutria nigriventer 
      spider.
PG  - 909-11
AB  - Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were developed to detect antigens from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom. Horse anti-P. nigriventer immunoglobulins were 
      prepared by immunoaffinity chromatography and used to set up a sandwich-type ELISA. 
      The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by its capacity to correctly 
      discriminate between the circulating antigens in mice that were experimentally 
      inoculated with P. nigriventer venom from those in mice inoculated with Lycosa sp. 
      and Loxosceles intermedia spider venoms, Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom and Apis 
      mellifera bee venom. Measurable absorbance signals were obtained with 0.8ng of venom 
      per assay. The ELISA was used to follow the kinetic distribution of antigens in 
      experimentally envenomed mice and to detect antigens in the sera of patients 
      envenomed by P. nigriventer.

AB  - Severe accidents caused by the "armed" spider Phoneutria nigriventer cause 
      neurotoxic manifestations in victims. In experiments with rats, P. nigriventer venom 
      (PNV) temporarily disrupts the properties of the BBB by affecting both the 
      transcellular and the paracellular route. However, it is unclear how cells and/or 
      proteins participate in the transient opening of the BBB. The present study 
      demonstrates that PNV is a substrate for the multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1) 
      in cultured astrocyte and endothelial cells (HUVEC) and increases mrp1 and cx43 and 
      down-regulates glut1 mRNA transcripts in cultured astrocytes. The inhibition of nNOS 
      by 7-nitroindazole suggests that NO derived from nNOS mediates some of these effects 
      by either accentuating or opposing the effects of PNV. In vivo, MRP1, GLUT1 and Cx43 
      protein expression is increased differentially in the hippocampus and cerebellum, 
      indicating region-related modulation of effects. PNV contains a plethora of Ca(2+), 
      K(+) and Na(+) channel-acting neurotoxins that interfere with glutamate handling. It 
      is suggested that the findings of the present study are the result of a complex 
      interaction of signaling pathways, one of which is the NO, which regulates 
      BBB-associated proteins in response to PNV interference on ions physiology. The 
      present study provides additional insight into PNV-induced BBB dysfunction and shows 
      that a protective mechanism is activated against the venom. The data shows that PNV 
      has qualities for potential use in drug permeability studies across the BBB.

TI  - Involvement of spinal neurokinins, excitatory amino acids, proinflammatory 
      cytokines, nitric oxide and prostanoids in pain facilitation induced by Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 101-11
AB  - The major local symptom of Phoneutria nigriventer envenomation is an intense pain, 
      which can be controlled by infiltration with local anesthetics or by systemic 
      treatment with opioid analgesics. Previous work showed that intraplantar (i.pl) 
      injection of Phoneutria nigriventer venom in rats induces hyperalgesia, mediated 
      peripherally by tachykinin and glutamate receptors. The present study examined the 
      spinal mechanisms involved in pain-enhancing effect of this venom. Intraplantar 
      injection of venom into rat hind paw induced hyperalgesia. This phenomenon was 
      inhibited by intrathecal (i.t.) injection of tachykinin NK1 (GR 82334) or NK2 (GR 
      94800) receptor antagonists, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor 
      antagonist (CGRP8-37) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; MK 801 and AP-5), non-NMDA 
      ionotropic (CNQX), or metabotropic (AIDA and MPEP) glutamate receptor antagonists, 
      suggesting the involvement of spinal neurokinins and excitatory amino acids. The 
      role of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), and prostanoids in spinally 
      mediated pain facilitation was also investigated. Pharmacological blockade of tumour 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) reduced the 
      hyperalgesic response to venom. Intrathecal injection of L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine 
      (L-NIL), but not of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), inhibited hyperalgesia induced by the 
      venom, indicating that NO, generated by the activity of the inducible form of nitric 
      oxide synthase, also mediates this phenomenon. Furthermore, indomethacin, an 
      inhibitor of cyclooxigenases (COX), or celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, 
      abolished venom-induced hyperalgesia, suggesting the involvement of spinal 
      prostanoids in this effect. These data indicate that the spinal mechanisms of pain 
      facilitation induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom involves a plethora of 
      mediators that may cooperate in the genesis of venom-induced central sensitization.

      boliviensis (Aranae:Ctenidae) (F. O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1897), done with Colombian 
      species. After the electrostimulation extraction process, the venom showed 
      physicochemical properties corresponding to a colorless and water-soluble liquid 
      with a density of 0.86 mg/mL and 87% aqueous content. P. boliviensis venom and 
      RP-HPLC fractions showed hemolytic activity and hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate 
      4-nitro-3-octanoyloxy-benzoic acid, indicating the presence of phospholipases A2 
      enzymes. The electrophoretic profile showed an important protein content with 
      molecular masses below 14 kDa, and differences between male and female protein 
      content were also revealed. The RP-HPLC venom profile exposes differences between 
      males and female content consistent with the electrophoretic profile. Five fractions 
      collected from the RP-HPLC displayed significant larvicidal activity. Mass analysis 
      indicates the presence of peptides ranging from 1047.71 to 3278.07 Da. Two peptides, 
      Ctenitoxin-Pb48 and Ctenitoxin-Pb53, were partially identified using 
      HPLC-nESI-MS/MS, which showed a high homology with other Ctenitoxins (family Tx3) 
      from Phoneutria nigriventer, Phoneutria keyserlingi and Phoneutria reidyi affecting 
      voltage-gated calcium receptors (Cav 1, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3) and NMDA-glutamate 
      receptors.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom activates 5-HT4 receptors in rat-isolated vagus 
      nerve.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - 1. The venom of Phoneutria nigriventer spider (PNV) causes intense pain and 
      inflammation following an attack. We have investigated the involvement of 
      capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibres by utilizing an in vitro nerve preparation. 
      Extracellular DC potential recordings were made from the rat-isolated vagus nerve, a 
      preparation that is rich in capsaicin-sensitive, that is, nociceptive, C-fibres. 2. 
      PNV (1-10 microg ml(-1)), capsaicin (0.03-0.3 microM) or 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT) 
      (0.3-3 microM) induced dose-dependent depolarizations of vagus nerve fibres. 
      Depolarizing responses to capsaicin were blocked by ruthenium red (RR, 10 microM), 
      but responses to PNV were not. Depolarizing responses to PNV or veratridine (50 
      microM) were inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10 microM), but those to capsaicin were 
      not. This suggests that capsaicin and PNV depolarize the nerve fibres by distinct 
      mechanisms. 3. Depolarization in response to 5-HT (3 microM) was reduced by the 
      5-HT(3) receptor antagonists Y25130 (0.5 micro M) and tropisetron (10 nM) or, to a 
      lesser extent, by the 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist RS39604 (1 or 10 microM). 
      Depolarizing responses to PNV were not affected significantly by Y25130 or 
      tropisetron, but were blocked by RS39604. 4. These data show that 5-HT(4) receptors 
      play a significant role in the activation of nociceptive sensory nerve fibres by PNV 
      and suggest that this is of importance in the development of the pain and 
      inflammation associated with bites from the P. nigriventer spider.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer Spider Toxin PnTx2-1 (δ-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a) Is a Modulator of 
      Sodium Channel Gating.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10090337 [doi]
LID - 337
AB  - Spider venoms are complex mixtures of biologically active components with 
      potentially interesting applications for drug discovery or for agricultural 
      purposes. The spider Phoneutria nigriventer is responsible for a number of 
      envenomations with sometimes severe clinical manifestations in humans. A more 
      efficient treatment requires a comprehensive knowledge of the venom composition and 
      of the action mechanism of the constituting components. PnTx2-1 (also called 
      δ-ctenitoxin-Pn1a) is a 53-amino-acid-residue peptide isolated from the venom 
      fraction PhTx2. Although PnTx2-1 is classified as a neurotoxin, its molecular target 
      has remained unknown. This study describes the electrophysiological characterization 
      of PnTx2-1 as a modulator of voltage-gated sodium channels. PnTx2-1 is investigated 
      for its activity on seven mammalian Na(V)-channel isoforms, one insect Na(V) channel 
      and one arachnid Na(V) channel. Furthermore, comparison of the activity of both 
      PnTx2-1 and PnTx2-6 on Na(V)1.5 channels reveals that this family of Phoneutria 
      toxins modulates the cardiac Na(V) channel in a bifunctional manner, resulting in an 
      alteration of the inactivation process and a reduction of the sodium peak current.

TI  - Ontogenetic changes in Phoneutria nigriventer (Araneae, Ctenidae) spider venom.
PG  - 635-40
AB  - Venom-yield and composition of differently sized individuals of the medically most 
      important Brazilian spider Phoneutria nigriventer (Keyserling, 1891) was analysed. 
      During growth the venom-mass increases according to a fourth order function of the 
      prosoma size, which mainly reflects an increase of the venom gland volume. Sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed increasing percentages 
      of proteins < or = 17 kDa from 4.1% in the smallest analysed spiders (2-3 
      months-old) to 79.1% in adult female venom. Additionally, high-pressure 
      liquid-chromatography showed an increase of a single ('main') peak from 4.6 to 
      64.9%, while the overall number of other major-peaks decreased. Venom from young 
      instars completely lacked lethality in mice up to a dose of 3.28 mg/kg i.v. as 
      compared to a LD(50) of 0.63 mg/kg for adult female or 1.57 mg/kg for adult male 
      venom that we reported previously. In conclusion, ontogenetic changes in venom 
      protein-composition of growing P. nigriventer are suggested to produce increasing 
      lethality in vertebrates.

TI  - Antinociceptive effect of PnTx4(5-5), a peptide from Phoneutria nigriventer spider 
      venom, in rat models and the involvement of glutamatergic system.
PG  - e20190022
LID - 10.1590/1678-9199-JVATITD-2019-0022 [doi]
LID - e20190022
AB  - BACKGROUND: The venom of Phoneutria nigriventer spider is a source of numerous 
      bioactive substances, including some toxins active in insects. An example is 
      PnTx4(5-5) that shows a high insecticidal activity and no apparent toxicity to mice, 
      although it inhibited NMDA-evoked currents in rat hippocampal neurons. In this work 
      the analgesic activity of PnTx4(5-5) (renamed Γ-ctenitoxin-Pn1a) was investigated. 
      METHODS: The antinociceptive activity was evaluated using the paw pressure test in 
      rats, after hyperalgesia induction with intraplantar injection of carrageenan or 
      prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). RESULTS: PnTx4(5-5), subcutaneously injected, was able 
      to reduce the hyperalgesia induced by PGE(2) in rat paw, demonstrating a systemic 
      effect. PnTx4(5-5) administered in the plantar surface of the paw caused a 
      peripheral and dose-dependent antinociceptive effect on hyperalgesia induced by 
      carrageenan or PGE(2). The hyperalgesic effect observed in these two pain models was 
      completely reversed with 5 µg of PnTx4(5-5). Intraplantar administration of 
      L-glutamate induced hyperalgesic effect that was significantly reverted by 5 μg of 
      PnTx4(5-5) injection in rat paw. CONCLUSION: The antinociceptive effect for 
      PnTx4(5-5) was demonstrated against different rat pain models, i.e. induced by 
      PGE(2), carrageenan or glutamate. We suggest that the antinociceptive effect of 
      PnTx4(5-5) may be related to an inhibitory activity on the glutamatergic system.

      histopathological investigation in mice.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider bite causes priapism, an effect attributed to the 
      peptide toxins Tx2-5 and Tx2-6 and involving nitric oxide. Tx2-6 (MW = 5287) is 
      known to delay the inactivation of Sodium channels in the same fashion as many other 
      venom toxins. In the present study we evaluated the i.p. dose that induces priapism 
      and the other symptoms in mice. Animals killed by the toxin or crude venom 
      (0.85 mg/kg) were autopsied and a pathological study of brain, lung, kidney, liver 
      and heart was undertaken using standard techniques. The same protocol was employed 
      with animals injected with crude venom. Results showed that priapism is the first 
      sign of intoxication, followed by piloerection, abundant salivation and tremors. An 
      i.p. injection of about 0.3 μg/kg induced only priapism with minimal side-effects. 
      The most remarkable histological finding was a general vascular congestion in all 
      organs studied. Penis showed no necrosis or damage. Lungs showed vascular congestion 
      and alveolar hemorrhage. Heart showed also sub-endothelial hemorrhage. Brain showed 
      only a mild edema and vascular congestion. Results obtained with crude venom closely 
      resemble those of purified toxin. We conclude that Tx2-6 have profound effects on 
      the vascular bed especially in lungs and heart, which may be the cause of death. 
      Interestingly brain tissue was less affected and the observed edema may be 
      attributed to respiratory impairment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first 
      histopathological investigation on this toxin and venom suggesting a possible cause 
      of death.

AB  - Envenomation by spiders of the genus Phoneutria ("banana spider") may be lethal, 
      especially in children. The only available specific treatment is the use of 
      antivenom, which is produced by only one laboratory in the world. In this study we 
      report the development of an equine F (ab')2 experimental antivenom raised against 
      the venom of Phoneutria nigriventer. The antivenom neutralized the venom of spiders 
      from different regions of Argentina (Misiones and Jujuy), the development of 
      envenomation symptoms in experimental animals was totally inhibited. These results 
      show that local production of this type of antivenom is possible. Independence of 
      production is important since international acquisition is always conditioned by the 
      availability of stock surplus from the sole producer.

TI  - In vitro effect of the Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom on cell viability, 
      paracellular barrier function and transcellular transport in cultured cell lines.
PG  - 130-41
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) induces, in rats, local edema as result of 
      an increased vascular permeability, as well as causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      breakdown by altering transendothelial transport routes in hippocampal microvessels. 
      In this work we investigated the in vitro effects of PNV on cell viability and 
      cellular transport routes using three cell lines, the ECV304 endothelial-, the C6 
      glioma- and the MDCK epithelial cells. We showed that PNV (14.6 and 292 microg crude 
      venom/ml culture medium) had no direct cytotoxic effect on both the ECV304 and the 
      MDCK cell lines but slightly reduced the viability of C6 glioma cells (P<0.05) at 
      the highest concentration, as revealed by the cellular neutral red uptake assay. The 
      PNV effects on cell transport were evaluated in MDCK cell line. PNV seems do not 
      cause any disturbance in the paracellular barrier function of the cultured MDCK 
      cells, as shown by the lack of a significant change in the distribution and 
      expression of the junctional proteins, ZO-1, occludin, E-cadherin and the 
      cytoskeletal F-actin. In contrast, PNV-treated MDCK monolayers showed an enhancement 
      in the transepithelial electrical resistance and a tendency towards an increased 
      occludin expression. In addition, the PNV significantly increased the apical 
      endocytosis of HRP, which was not followed by an equivalent exocytosis at the basal 
      side, as revealed by biochemical and ultrastructural methods. We conclude that the 
      venom of P. nigriventer displays a relatively low cytotoxicity in vitro as well as 
      activates directly the endocytic transport pathway in MDCK cells without disrupting 
      the paracellular route.

TI  - A novel tool for the investigation of glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical 
      synaptosomes: the toxin Tx3-3 from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - The present experiments investigated the effect of some of the toxic components 
      present in the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer on the release of 
      neurotransmitter. The toxic fraction, Phoneutria nigriventer toxin-3 (PhTx3), 
      abolished Ca2+-dependent glutamate release, but did not alter Ca2+-independent 
      secretion of glutamate when rat brain cortical synaptosomes were depolarized with 33 
      mM KCl. This effect was most likely due to interference with the entry of calcium 
      through voltage-gated calcium channels, because PhTx3 reduced by 50% the increase in 
      intrasynaptosomal free calcium induced by membrane depolarization, and did not 
      affect the release of glutamate evoked by a calcium ionophore (ionomycin). A 
      polypeptide (Tx3-3) present in the PhTx3 fraction reproduced the effects of the 
      PhTx3 fraction on transmitter release and intrasynaptosomal free calcium in the low 
      nanomolar range. We compared the alterations produced by the Tx3-3 with the actions 
      of toxins known to block calcium channels coupled to exocytosis: the results 
      indicated that the Tx3-3 inhibition of glutamate release and intrasynaptosomal 
      calcium resemble that observed with omega-conotoxin MVIIC. We suggest that the Tx3-3 
      is a calcium-channel antagonist that blocked glutamate exocytosis.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that the venom of Phoneutria nigriventer (PNV) 
      armed-spider causes excitotoxic signals and blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb) in 
      rats. Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule which has a role in endothelium 
      homeostasis and vascular health. The present study investigated the relevance of 
      endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling to clinical neurotoxic evolution induced 
      by PNV. eNOS immunoblotting of cerebellum lysates processed through low-temperature 
      SDS-PAGE revealed significant increased monomerization of the enzyme at critical 
      periods of severe envenoming (1-2 h), whereas eNOS dimerization reversal paralleled 
      to amelioration of animals condition (5-72 h). Moreover, eNOS uncoupling was 
      accompanied by increased expression in calcium-sensing calmodulin protein and 
      calcium-binding calbindin-D28 protein in cerebellar neurons. It is known that 
      greater eNOS monomers than dimers implies the inability of eNOS to produce NO 
      leading to superoxide production and endothelial/vascular barrier dysfunction. We 
      suggest that transient eNOS deactivation and disturbances in calcium handling reduce 
      NO production and enhance production of free radicals thus contributing to 
      endothelial dysfunction in the cerebellum of envenomed rats. In addition, eNOS 
      uncoupling compromises the enzyme capacity to respond to shear stress contributing 
      to perivascular edema and it is one of the mechanisms involved in the BBBb promoted 
      by PNV.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider accidental envenomation provokes neurotoxic 
      manifestations, which when critical, results in epileptic-like episodes. In rats, P. 
      nigriventer venom (PNV) causes blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb). The PNV-induced 
      excitotoxicity results from disturbances on Na(+), K(+) and Ca(2+) channels and 
      glutamate handling. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), beyond its 
      angiogenic effect, also, interferes on synaptic physiology by affecting the same ion 
      channels and protects neurons from excitotoxicity. However, it is unknown whether 
      VEGF expression is altered following PNV envenomation. We found that adult and 
      neonates rats injected with PNV showed immediate neurotoxic manifestations which 
      paralleled with endothelial occludin, β-catenin, and laminin downregulation 
      indicative of BBBb. In neonate rats, VEGF, VEGF mRNA, and Flt-1 receptors, glutamate 
      decarboxylase, and calbindin-D28k increased in Purkinje neurons, while, in adult 
      rats, the BBBb paralleled with VEGF mRNA, Flk-1, and calbindin-D28k increases and 
      Flt-1 decreases. Statistically, the variable age had a role in such differences, 
      which might be due to age-related unequal maturation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      and thus differential cross-signaling among components of the glial neurovascular 
      unit. The concurrent increases in the VEGF/Flt-1/Flk-1 system in the cerebellar 
      neuron cells and the BBBb following PNV exposure might imply a cytokine modulation 
      of neuronal excitability consequent to homeostatic perturbations induced by ion 
      channels-acting PNV neuropeptides. Whether such modulation represents 
      neuroprotection needs further investigation.

      changes protein expression at the blood-brain barrier.

AB  - PhTx2 is the most toxic fraction from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, being responsible to sodium entry into cortical synaptosomes, 
      increasing the release of neurotransmitters, such as l-glutamate (L-Glu) and; 
      acetylcholine. In this study, we investigated the action of a toxin purified from; 
      PhTx2 fraction, called PnTx2-6 or δ-CNTX-Pn2a, on L-Glu release from rat; brain 
      cortex synaptosomes, as well as its ability to induce blood-brain barrier 
      permeability. PnTx2-6 increased L-Glu release from rat cortical brain synaptosomes 
      in a time- and dose-dependent manner (EC50 = ∼20 nM; Tm = 16min), as measured by a 
      fluorimetric method. The increase of L-Glu by PnTx2-6 was inhibited by tetrodotoxin. 
      And partially inhibited by EGTA. Calcium channel blockers ω-conotoxin MVIIC 
      (P/Q-types) and ω-conotoxin GVIA (N-type), were able to reduce the PnTx2-6-induced 
      release of L-Glu, while nifedipine (L-type) did not show any inhibition. These 
      findings suggest that thew release of L-Glu by PnTx2-6 is due its primary action on 
      sodium channels, well-known to be target of this toxin. PnTx2-6 is able to 
      potentiate penile erection and this effect may be related with the release of 
      l-glutamate from the CNS, besides a local effect on corpus carvenosum, as previously 
      shown by our group. If L-Glu release and penile erection potentiation are indeed 
      correlated, then this toxin should be able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). 
      Results by immunoblotting assays indicated a change in the expression of proteins 
      associated with the paracellular and transcellular transport at the blood-brain 
      barrier, suggesting a BBB dysfunction mediated by PnTx2-6. Therefore, PnTx2-6 may 
      induce the release l-glutamate in the central nervous system, when injected 
      peripherally.

TI  - Functional expression and purification of recombinant Tx1, a sodium channel blocker 
      neurotoxin from the venom of the Brazilian "armed" spider, Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 18-24
AB  - Tx1 from the venom of the Brazilian spider, Phoneutria nigriventer, is a lethal 
      neurotoxic polypeptide of M(r) 8600 Da with 14 cysteine residues. It is a novel 
      sodium channel blocker which reversibly inhibits sodium currents in CHO cells 
      expressing recombinant sodium (Nav1.2) channels. We cloned and expressed the Tx1 
      toxin as a thioredoxin fusion product in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. After 
      semipurification by immobilized Ni-ion affinity chromatography, the recombinant Tx1 
      was purified by reverse phase chromatography and characterized. It displayed similar 
      biochemical and pharmacological properties to the native toxin, and it should be 
      useful for further investigation of structure-function relationship of Na channels.

TI  - Phα1β, a peptide from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer shows 
      antinociceptive effects after continuous infusion in a neuropathic pain model in 
      rats.
PG  - 196-202
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000000249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is a severe painful pathology that is difficult to 
      treat. One option for its management is the continuous intrathecal (i.t.) infusion 
      of ziconotide (the Conus magnus peptide ω-conotoxin MVIIA), which, in addition to 
      being effective, produces serious adverse effects at analgesic doses. Single i.t. 
      administration of Phα1β, a peptide purified from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, has antinociceptive effects with a greater therapeutic window than 
      ziconotide in rodents. To further evaluate its analgesic potential, we investigated 
      the antinociceptive and toxic effects of Phα1β after single or continuous i.t. 
      infusion in a rat model of neuropathic pain. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats 
      (200-300 g) bred in-house were used. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the 
      sciatic nerve was used as the neuropathic pain model. Nociception was assessed by 
      detecting mechanical hyperalgesia, considering a significant reduction in 50% paw 
      withdrawal threshold values after CCI compared with baseline values. First, we 
      assessed the antinociceptive effect of a single i.t. injection of Phα1β (10, 30, or 
      100 pmol/site) in a model of neuropathic pain 8 days after nerve injury. In a 
      different experiment, we delivered Phα1β (60 pmol/μL/h) or vehicle 
      (phosphate-buffered saline, 1.0 μL/h) through continuous infusion using an osmotic 
      pump by spinal catheterization for 7 days in rats submitted to nerve injury. 
      Behavioral adverse effects were evaluated after single or continuous Phα1β i.t. 
      administration, and histopathological analysis of spinal cord, brainstem, and 
      encephalon was performed after continuous Phα1β i.t. injection. RESULTS: We observed 
      that CCI of the sciatic nerve but not sham surgery caused intense (reduction of 
      approximately 2.5 times in mechanical withdrawal threshold) and persistent (up to 14 
      days) nociception in rats. The single i.t. injection of Phα1β (30 or 100 pmol/site) 
      reduced neuropathic nociception from 1 to 6 hours after administration, without 
      showing detectable side effects. Similarly, the continuous infusion of Phα1β (60 
      pmol/μL/h for 7 days) was also able to reverse nerve injury-induced nociception from 
      1 to 7 days, but did not cause either behavioral side effects or histopathological 
      changes in the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we have shown for the 
      first time that the continuous i.t. delivery of Phα1β produces analgesia 
      disconnected from toxicity in a relevant model of neuropathic pain, indicating that 
      it is an effective and safe drug with a great potential to treat pain.

TI  - Binding sites and actions of Tx1, a neurotoxin from the venom of the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, in guinea pig ileum.
PG  - 1565-9
AB  - Tx1, a neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the South American spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, produces tail elevation, behavioral excitation and spastic paralysis of 
      the hind limbs after intracerebroventricular injection in mice. Since Tx1 contracts 
      isolated guinea pig ileum, we have investigated the effect of this toxin on 
      acetylcholine release, as well as its binding to myenteric plexus-longitudinal 
      muscle membranes from the guinea pig ileum. [125I]-Tx1 binds specifically and with 
      high affinity (Kd = 0.36 +/- 0.02 nM) to a single, non-interacting (nH = 1.1), low 
      capacity (Bmax 1.1 pmol/mg protein) binding site. In competition experiments using 
      several compounds (including ion channel ligands), only PhTx2 and PhTx3 competed 
      with [125I]-Tx1 for specific binding sites (K0.5 apparent = 7.50 x 10(-4) g/l and 
      1.85 x 10(-5) g/l, respectively). PhTx2 and PhTx3, fractions from P. nigriventer 
      venom, contain toxins acting on sodium and calcium channels, respectively. However, 
      the neurotoxin PhTx2-6, one of the isoforms found in the PhTx2 pool, did not affect 
      [125I]-Tx1 binding. Tx1 reduced the [3H]-ACh release evoked by the PhTx2 pool by 
      33%, but did not affect basal or KCl-induced [3H]-ACh release. Based on these 
      results, as well as on the homology of Tx1 with toxins acting on calcium channels 
      (omega-Aga IA and IB) and its competition with [125I]-omega-Cono GVIA in the central 
      nervous system, we suggest that the target site for Tx1 may be calcium channels.

TI  - Systemic envenomation caused by the wandering spider Phoneutria nigriventer, with 
      quantification of circulating venom.
PG  - 885-9
LID - 10.1080/15563650802258524 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bites by Phoneutria spp. spiders are common in Brazil, although only 
      0.5-1% result in severe envenomation, with most of these occurring in children. 
      Cases of systemic envenomation in adults are very unusual, and no serum venom levels 
      have been previously quantified in these cases. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old man was 
      bitten on the neck by an adult female Phoneutria nigriventer. Immediately after the 
      bite, there was intense local pain followed by blurred vision, profuse sweating, 
      tremors, and an episode of vomiting; 1-2 h post bite the patient showed agitation 
      and a blood pressure of 200/130 mmHg, and was given captopril and meperidine. Upon 
      admission to our service 4 h post bite (time zero - T0), his blood pressure was 
      130/80 mmHg with a heart rate of 150 beats/min, mild tachypnea, agitation, cold 
      extremities, profuse sweating, generalized tremors, and priapism. The patient was 
      treated with antivenom, local anesthetic, and fluid replacement. Most of the 
      systemic manifestations disappeared within 1 h after antivenom. Laboratory blood 
      analyses at T0, T1, T6, T24, and T48 detected circulating venom by ELISA only at T0, 
      before antivenom infusion (47.5 ng/mL; cut-off, 17.1 ng/mL); his serum blood sugar 
      was 163 mg/dL at T0. The patient was discharged on the second day with a normal 
      arterial blood pressure and a follow-up evaluation revealed no sequelae. CONCLUSION: 
      This is the first report of confirmed moderate/severe envenoming in an adult caused 
      by P. nigriventer with the quantification of circulating venom.

TI  - Involvement of vanilloid receptors and purinoceptors in the Phoneutria nigriventer 
      spider venom-induced plasma extravasation in rat skin.
PG  - 305-15
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer venom causes stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive primary 
      afferent neurons in the rat dorsal skin, leading to neurogenic plasma protein 
      extravasation due to the release of tachykinin NK(1) receptor agonist. In this study 
      we further investigated the mechanisms involved in the venom-induced activation of 
      capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurons. The plasma extravasation in response 
      to venom intradermally injected was measured in Wistar rats as the local 
      accumulation of i.v. injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin into skin sites. The 
      tachykinin NK(1) receptor agonist, D-Ala-[L-Pro(9),Me-Leu(8)]substance P-(7-11) 
      (GR73632; 10-100 pmol/site), induced a significant plasma leakage that was abolished 
      by the selective tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, 
      (S)-1-[2-[3-(3,4-dichlorphenyl)-1 (3-isopropoxyphenylacetyl) piperidin-3-yl] 
      ethyl]-4-phenyl-1 azaniabicyclo [2.2.2]octane chloride (SR140333; 1 nmol/site), 
      whereas the leakage after venom (1-10 microgram/site) was significantly inhibited 
      (but not abolished) by SR140333. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor 
      antagonist, CGRP-(8-37), failed to further reduce the residual plasma extravasation 
      induced by venom plus SR140333. The mu-opioid receptor agonist, [D-Ala(2), 
      Me-Phe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO), and the local anaesthetic, lignocaine, had 
      no effect on the venom-induced plasma extravasation. Similarly, the L-, N- and 
      P/Q-type voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel blockers (verapamil, omega-conotoxin MVIIA 
      and MVIIC, respectively) as well as the Na(+) channel blockers, tetrodotoxin and 
      carbamazepine, had no effect on the venom-induced effect. Neither the systemic 
      treatment nor the local injection of ruthenium red prevented the venom-induced 
      plasma extravasation. However, the vanilloid receptor antagonist, 
      N-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) ethyl]-1,3,4, 
      5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-2H-2-benzazepine-2-carbothioamide (capsazepine; 120 
      micromol/kg, i.v.), reduced by 48% (P<0.05) the venom (10 microgram/site)-induced 
      plasma extravasation. A significant inhibitory effect was also observed with the 
      P(2) purinoceptor agonists, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP; 10 and 30 nmol/site) and 
      adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP; 10 nmol/site). The involvement of histamine and/or 
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the venom-induced plasma extravasation was ruled out 
      since neither histamine and 5-HT receptor antagonists nor depletion of mast cells by 
      compound 48/80 affected the venom response. This was further supported by the 
      failure of venom to degranulate in vitro peritoneal mast cells. In conclusion, only 
      vanilloid receptors and P(2) prejunctional purinoceptors had an inhibitory effect on 
      the neurogenic plasma extravasation evoked by P. nigriventer venom in rat dorsal 
      skin.

TI  - Age-Related Modulations of AQP4 and Caveolin-1 in the Hippocampus Predispose the 
      Toxic Effect of Phoneutria nigriventer Spider Venom.
LID - 1462
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that Phoneutria nigriventer venom (PNV) causes 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, swelling of astrocytes end-feet and fluid 
      permeation into brain interstitium in rats. Caveolae and water channels respond to 
      BBB alterations by co-participation in shear stress response and edema 
      formation/resolution. Herein, we showed post-natal developmental-related changes of 
      two BBB-associated transporter proteins: the endothelial caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the 
      major scaffolding protein from caveolae frame, and the astroglial aquaporin-4 
      (AQP4), the main water channel protein expressed in astrocytic peri-vascular 
      end-feet processes, in the hippocampus of rats intraperitoneally-administered PNV. 
      Western blotting protein levels; immunohistochemistry (IHC) protein distribution in 
      CA1, CA2, and CA3 subfields; and gene expression by Real Time-Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (qPCR) were assessed in post-natal Day 14 (P14) and 8-10-week-old rats over 
      critical periods of envenomation. The intensity and duration of the toxic 
      manifestations indicate P14 neonate rats more vulnerable to PNV than adults. 
      Histologically, the capillaries of P14 and 8-10-week-old rats treated with PNV 
      showed perivascular edema, while controls did not. The intensity of the toxic 
      manifestations in P14 decreases temporally (2 > 5 > 24 h), while inversely the 
      expression of AQP4 and Cav-1 peaked at 24 h when clinically PNV-treated animals do 
      not differ from saline controls. IHC of AQP4 revealed that hippocampal CA1 showed 
      the least expression at 2 h when toxic manifestation was maximal. Subfield IHC 
      quantification revealed that in P14 rats Cav-1 peaked at 24 h when toxic 
      manifestations were absent, whereas in 8-10-week-old rats Cav-1 peaked at 2 h when 
      toxic signs were highest, and progressively attenuated such increases until 24 h, 
      remaining though significantly above baseline. Considering astrocyte-endothelial 
      physical and functional interactions, we hypothesize that age-related modulations of 
      AQP4 and Cav-1 might be linked both to changes in functional properties of 
      astrocytes during post-natal development and in the BBB breakdown induced by the 
      venom of P. nigriventer.

TI  - Effect of Phoneutria nigriventer venom on the expression of junctional protein and 
      P-gp efflux pump function in the blood-brain barrier.
PG  - 1967-81
LID - 10.1007/s11064-012-0817-y [doi]
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) contains Ca(2+), K(+) and Na(+) 
      channel-acting peptides that affect neurotransmitter release and causes 
      excitotoxicity in PNS and CNS. It has been demonstrated that PNV causes blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB) breakdown of hippocampal microvessels time-dependently through 
      enhanced microtubule-mediated vesicular transport. Herein, it is hypothesized that 
      PNV can cause BBB breakdown in the hippocampus and cerebellum time-dependently 
      through other molecular mechanisms. The BBB integrity was assessed through the 
      analysis of expression of Poly-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter protein, 
      laminin from basement membrane and endothelial tight junctional and adhesion 
      junctional (TJ/AJ) proteins. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and protein 
      phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, which are known to have a role in the 
      phosphorylation of junctional proteins and BBB opening, were also investigated. 
      Astrocytes P-gp activity was determined by flow cytometry. The study demonstrated 
      temporary decreased expression of laminin, TJ and AJ proteins 
      (ZO1//occludin//claudin-5//beta-catenin) and P-gp (more prominently in hippocampus), 
      which was completely or partially resolved between 2 and 5 h (and more quickly for 
      cerebellum). PNV inhibited P-gp activity in astrocytes. PP2A phosphorylation, which 
      inhibits the enzyme activity, was increased in both regions (15-45 min); however the 
      phosphorylation level returned to baseline after 2 h. In conclusion, PNV disrupts 
      paracellular transport in the BBB and possesses substrates for the active P-gp 
      efflux transporter located in the BBB complex. Further studies into cellular 
      mechanisms of astrocyte/endothelial interactions, using PNV as tool, may identify 
      how astrocytes regulate the BBB, a characteristic that may be useful for the 
      temporary opening of the BBB.

TI  - Intersexual variations in the venom of the Brazilian 'armed' spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer (Keyserling, 1891).
PG  - 1399-406
AB  - Venom from male and female specimens of the medically most important Brazilian 
      Ctenidae spider Phoneutria nigriventer (Keyserling, 1891) has been compared. Males 
      showed a slightly higher venom yield (386 microg) than equal sized females (296 
      microg), while adult females showed nearly a three times higher venom yield (1079 
      microg). High-pressure liquid-chromatography analyses revealed differences in the 
      venom composition between males and females. A single peak in HPLC (peak 11) was 
      only detected in venom from females carrying egg-sacs, and sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate-gel electrophoresis showed a series of high molecular weight proteins only 
      in the male venom pool. The median lethal dose (LD(50)) in mice for female venom was 
      0.63 microg kg(-1) (95% confidence interval [0.54; 0.71] and 0.61 [0.56; 0.73] 
      microg kg(-1)) for females with egg-sacs, when compared to the male venom which 
      showed a LD(50) of 1.57 [1.46; 1.88] microg kg(-1). The venom of both sexes was also 
      tested in insects using a termite bioassay with doses of 2, 3, 4, and 5 microg per 
      termite. No effect was detected for the lowest dose of female venom, whereas all the 
      other venom doses from both sexes caused a decreased paralysis time and death of the 
      termites. Comparing the venom of both sexes, it was observed that female venom 
      provoked a faster reaction than male venom. The results indicate that males and 
      females of P.nigriventer have differing venom composition which lead to different 
      effects in biological assays.

TI  - Erectile function is improved in aged rats by PnTx2-6, a toxin from Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 2574-81
LID - 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02878.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Age-associated erectile dysfunction (ED) involves a decrease in nitric 
      oxide (NO) availability and impaired relaxation. PnTx2-6, a toxin from the 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider, has been demonstrated to improve erectile function 
      via NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. This spider's venom is 
      characterized by several symptoms, including erection. PnTx2-6 has been implicated 
      in this phenomenon. Animal venoms have been postulated as potential drugs to treat 
      ED. AIM: PnTx2-6 toxin improves erectile function in aged rats via NO/cGMP. We 
      investigated the effect of PnTx2-6 in the erectile function of aged rats. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: ED was evaluated through changes in intracavernosal pressure/mean 
      arterial pressure ratio during electrical field stimulation (EFS) of the pelvic 
      ganglion of aged and adult rats (70 vs. 14 weeks). In functional studies, 
      EFS-induced relaxation of corpus cavernosum (CC) strips were performed with or 
      without PnTx2-6 (10-8M). RESULTS: The decrease in erectile function associated with 
      age was partially restored 15-20 minutes after injection of PnTx2-6 and further 
      improved by sildenafil. PnTx2-6 enhanced EFS-induced relaxation, as well as cGMP 
      levels in CC, from young and aged rats. Relaxation due to PnTx2-6 was further 
      increased after 30 minutes incubation with Y-27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor (10-6 M), 
      in aging CC. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in aged and young cavernosal 
      tissue was increased by incubation with PnTx2-6 (10 minutes). However, this toxin 
      did not modify NOS expression. CONCLUSION: PnTx2-6 improves penile relaxation in 
      aged rats, via increased NOS activity and NO release, resulting in enhanced cGMP 
      levels.

TI  - The purification and amino acid sequence of the lethal neurotoxin Tx1 from the venom 
      of the Brazilian 'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 251-3
AB  - A lethal neurotoxic polypeptide of Mr 8 kDa was purified from the venom of the South 
      American 'armed' or wandering spider Phoneutria nigriventer by centrifugation, gel 
      filtration on Superose 12, and reverse phase FPLC on columns of Pharmacia PepRPC and 
      ProRPC. The purified neurotoxin Tx1 had an LD50 of 0.05 mg/kg in mice following 
      intracerebroventricular injection. The complete amino acid sequence of the 
      neurotoxin was determined by automated Edman degradation of the native and 
      S-carboxymethylated protein in pulsed liquid and dual phase sequencers, and by the 
      manual DABITC/PITC double coupling method applied to fragments obtained after 
      digestions with the S. aureus V8 protease and trypsin. The neurotoxin Tx1 consists 
      of a single chain of 77 amino acid residues, which contains a high proportion of 
      cysteine. The primary structure showed no homology to other identified spider 
      toxins.

TI  - Cloning, cDNA sequence analysis and patch clamp studies of a toxin from the venom of 
      the armed spider (Phoneutria nigriventer).
PG  - 1971-80
AB  - The cDNAs (Tx3-2 and Pn3A) encoding precursor of toxin Tx3-2 and an isoform called 
      Pn3A have been isolated from a library constructed from stimulated venom glands of 
      the spider Phoneutria nigriventer. The cDNA of Tx3-2 reveals the presence of a 
      signal peptide of 21 amino acids and of an intervening propeptide (with 16 amino 
      acids) preceding the toxin sequence, which was followed by additional amino acid 
      residues at the C-terminus (C-terminal peptide), implying post-translational 
      modifications of the synthesised peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence for the 
      mature toxin confirms the previous sequence published. In addition, by using the 
      whole-cell patch clamp technique, we have determined that purified Tx3-2 decreases 
      L-type currents present in GH3 cells. Finally, the presence of the cDNA Pn3A, with 
      high sequence identity with Tx3-2, reveals the existence of a putative new toxin 
      showing, at the cDNA level, 85.4% identity in its whole segment.

TI  - Comparative effect of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom and capsaicin on the rat 
      paw oedema.
PG  - 1573-85
AB  - Capsaicin, the pungent component of hot peppers, and the venom of the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer are able to activate sensory nerves resulting in cutaneous 
      neurogenic plasma extravasation. This study was undertaken to compare the ability of 
      these substances to evoke oedema in the rat hind-paw and mechanisms underlying this 
      effect. Subplantar injection of either Phoneutria nigriventer venom (PNV; 1-100 
      microg/paw) or capsaicin (10-200 microg/paw) caused a significant paw oedema that 
      was potentiated by CGRP (10 pmol/paw). In rats treated neonatally with capsaicin to 
      deplete neuropeptides, the paw oedema induced by either PNV (100 microg/paw) or 
      capsaicin (100 microg/paw) was partially reduced (P<0.05). The tachykinin NK1 
      receptor antagonist SR140333 (0.2 micromol/kg; i.v.) prevented the paw oedema 
      induced by the tachykinin NK1 receptor agonist GR73632 (30 pmol/paw) and partially 
      reduced paw oedema induced by PNV or capsaicin. Treatment of rats with compound 
      48/80 (5 mg/kg; s.c. 3 days) or with both H1 receptor antagonist (mepyramine; 1 
      nmol/paw) and 5-HT receptor antagonist (methysergide; 1 nmol/paw) significantly 
      inhibited PNV- or capsaicin-induced paw oedema. The combined treatment with 
      mepyramine and methysergide and SR140333 further reduced PNV- and capsaicin-induced 
      paw oedema. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 affected neither PNV- nor 
      capsaicin-induced responses. Our results suggest that PNV and capsaicin each induce 
      paw oedema that is partially mediated by activation of sensory fibers culminating in 
      the release of substance P as well as by activation of mast cells which in turn 
      release amines such as histamine and 5-HT.

TI  - Tx3-4 a toxin from the venom of spider Phoneutria nigriventer blocks calcium 
      channels associated with exocytosis.
PG  - 170-2
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2008.05.019 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the present work was to investigate the pharmacological action of a 
      calcium channel-blocking toxin from the venom of the spider Phonetic nigriventer, 
      Tx3-4 on calcium channels coupled to exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Tx3-4 blocked 
      KCl-induced exocytosis of synaptic vesicles with an IC50 of 1.1 nM. To investigate 
      whether the target of Tx3-4 overlaps with known calcium channels that mediate 
      calcium entry and exocytosis, we used omega-toxins that interact selectively with 
      neuronal calcium channels. The results indicate that the main population of 
      voltage-sensitive calcium channels altered by Tx3-4 is P/Q calcium channels. In 
      conclusion, Tx3-4 is a potent inhibitor of calcium channels involved in the 
      KCl-induced exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in brain cortical synaptosomes.

TI  - Action of Phα1β, a peptide from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, on 
      the analgesic and adverse effects caused by morphine in mice.
PG  - 619-31

AB  - Opioids are standard therapy for the treatment of pain; however, adverse effects 
      limit their use. Voltage-gated calcium channel blockers may be used to increase 
      opioid analgesia, but their effect on opioid-induced side effects is little known. 
      Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the action of the peptide Phα1β, a 
      voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, on the antinociceptive and adverse effects 
      produced by morphine in mice. A single administration of morphine (3-10 mg/kg) was 
      able to reduce heat nociception as well as decrease gastrointestinal transit. The 
      antinociception caused by a single injection of morphine was slightly increased by 
      an intrathecal injection of Phα1β (30 pmol/site). Repeated treatment with morphine 
      caused tolerance, hyperalgesia, withdrawal syndrome, and constipation, and the Phα1β 
      (.1-30 pmol/site, intrathecal) was able to reverse these effects. Finally, the 
      effects produced by the native form of Phα1β were fully mimicked by a recombinant 
      version of this peptide. Taken together, these data show that Phα1β was effective in 
      potentiating the analgesia caused by a single dose of morphine as well as in 
      reducing tolerance and the adverse effects induced by repeated administration of 
      morphine, indicating its potential use as an adjuvant drug in combination with 
      opioids. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents preclinical evidence for a useful 
      adjuvant drug in opioid treatment. Phα1β, a peptide calcium channel blocker, could 
      be used not only to potentiate morphine analgesia but also to reduce the adverse 
      effects caused by repeated administration of morphine.

TI  - How important are NK1 receptors for influencing microvascular inflammation and itch 
      in the skin? Studies using Phoneutria nigriventer venom.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - Pain and itch sensations are induced by depolarization of C-fibre nerves and 
      possibly other types of fibres. We have evidence from several species, including 
      mice, that skin plasma extravasation induced by the Phoneutria nigriventer spider 
      venom (PNV) is dependent on tachykinin NK(1) receptors. We have now investigated the 
      itching measured as bouts of scratching in response to intradermal (i.d.) PNV in 
      wildtype (NK(1)(+/+)) and NK(1) receptor knockout (NK(1)(-/-)) mice. Mice, either 
      NK(1)(+/+) or NK(1)(-/-), were given a single i.d. injection (0.05 ml) of test agent 
      or vehicle into the shaved dorsal skin, in the intercostal region, in a randomized 
      way. The bouts of scratching were recorded in a blinded manner for 60 min. Oedema 
      formation was concomitantly assessed by the extravascular accumulation of i.v. 
      injected (125)I-albumin. The i.d. injection of either substance P (at a high dose of 
      100 nmol/site), or PNV (0.3-10 microg/site) induced oedema formation in NK(1)(+/+) 
      but substantially less was observed in NK(1)(-/-) mice, as previously reported. PNV 
      also induced scratching, but significantly less scratching was observed in 
      NK(1)(-/-) compared with NK(1)(+/+) mice. In contrast, SP did not induce significant 
      scratching at amounts up to 100 nmol in NK(1)(+/+) mice. Experiments with an NK(1) 
      receptor antagonist SR140333 (at doses that blocked PNV-induced oedema) revealed 
      that whilst a local co-injection i.d. (1 nmol) in NK(1)(+/+) mice had no effect on 
      PNV (3 microg/site)-induced scratching (18.5+/-3.7 vs. 14.4+/-3.5 bouts, 
      mean+/-S.E.M., n=5-7), systemic treatment with SR140333 (120 nmol/kg, i.v.) 
      significantly inhibited scratching (14+/-3.5 vs. 3.1+/-1.2 bouts, n=4-6; P<0.05). 
      These results indicate that NK(1) receptors are involved in mediating PNV-induced 
      scratching and that the location of the receptors is unlikely to be skin. Thus, a 
      distinct separation between endogenous microvascular and PNV nociceptive 
      NK(1)-dependent effects is suggested.

TI  - δ-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a, a Peptide from Phoneutria nigriventer Spider Venom, Shows 
      Antinociceptive Effect Involving Opioid and Cannabinoid Systems, in Rats.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.3390/toxins8040106 [doi]
LID - 106
AB  - PnTx4(6-1), henceforth renamed δ-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a (δ-CNTX-Pn1a), a peptide from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom, initially described as an insect toxin, binds 
      to site 3 of sodium channels in nerve cord synaptosomes and slows down sodium 
      current inactivation in isolated axons in cockroaches (Periplaneta americana). 
      δ-CNTX-Pn1a does not cause any apparent toxicity to mice, when 
      intracerebroventricularly injected (30 μg). In this study, we evaluated the 
      antinociceptive effect of δ-CNTX-Pn1a in three animal pain models and investigated 
      its mechanism of action in acute pain. In the inflammatory pain model, induced by 
      carrageenan, δ-CNTX-Pn1a restored the nociceptive threshold of rats, when 
      intraplantarly injected, 2 h and 30 min after carrageenan administration. Concerning 
      the neuropathic pain model, δ-CNTX-Pn1a, when intrathecally administered, reversed 
      the hyperalgesia evoked by sciatic nerve constriction. In the acute pain model, 
      induced by prostaglandin E₂, intrathecal administration of δ-CNTX-Pn1a caused a 
      dose-dependent antinociceptive effect. Using antagonists of the receptors, we showed 
      that the antinociceptive effect of δ-CNTX-Pn1a involves both the cannabinoid system, 
      through CB₁ receptors, and the opioid system, through μ and δ receptors. Our data 
      show, for the first time, that δ-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a is able to induce antinociception 
      in inflammatory, neuropathic and acute pain models.

PG  - 1225-33
AB  - Three neurotoxic fractions, lethal to mice, were isolated from the venom of the 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer, by gel filtration and reverse phase chromatography 
      (Phoneutria toxins 1, 2 and 3). These toxins have mol. wts in the range 6000-9000, 
      and have different amino acid compositions and N-terminal amino acid sequences. The 
      toxins also differ in the lethality and signs they cause in mice after 
      intracerebro-ventricular injection. The median LD50 being respectively for the whole 
      venom, toxins 1, 2 and 3, 47 +/- 5 micrograms, 45 +/- 4 micrograms, 1.7 +/- 0.7 
      micrograms and 137 +/- 10 micrograms/kg mouse. Toxins 1 and 2 induce excitatory 
      symptoms in mice and toxin 3 a flaccid paralysis with an ED50 of 40 +/- 5 
      micrograms/kg mouse as measured also by intracerebro-ventricular injection. The 
      presence in the venom of a non-neurotoxic, smooth muscle active peptide is also 
      described.

AB  - Spider venoms contain neurotoxic peptides aimed at paralyzing prey or for defense 
      against predators; that is why they represent valuable tools for studies in 
      neuroscience field. The present study aimed at identifying the process of 
      internalization that occurs during the increased trafficking of vesicles caused by 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV)-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      breakdown. Herein, we found that caveolin-1α is up-regulated in the cerebellar 
      capillaries and Purkinje neurons of PNV-administered P14 (neonate) and 8- to 
      10-week-old (adult) rats. The white matter and granular layers were regions where 
      caveolin-1α showed major upregulation. The variable age played a role in this 
      effect. Caveolin-1 is the central protein that controls caveolae formation. 
      Caveolar-specialized cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane sub-domains are 
      involved in endocytosis, transcytosis, mechano-sensing, synapse formation and 
      stabilization, signal transduction, intercellular communication, apoptosis, and 
      various signaling events, including those related to calcium handling. PNV is 
      extremely rich in neurotoxic peptides that affect glutamate handling and interferes 
      with ion channels physiology. We suggest that the PNV-induced BBB opening is 
      associated with a high expression of caveolae frame-forming caveolin-1α, and 
      therefore in the process of internalization and enhanced transcytosis. Caveolin-1α 
      up-regulation in Purkinje neurons could be related to a way of neurons to preserve, 
      restore, and enhance function following PNV-induced excitotoxicity. The findings 
      disclose interesting perspectives for further molecular studies of the interaction 
      between PNV and caveolar specialized membrane domains. It proves PNV to be excellent 
      tool for studies of transcytosis, the most common form of BBB-enhanced permeability.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider toxin Tx2-6 induces priapism in mice even after 
      cavernosal denervation.

AB  - The Phoneutria nigriventer spider toxin Tx2-6 causes priapism in humans and mice. 
      This toxin produces a delay in Sodium channel inactivation, generalized vascular 
      congestion and death by respiratory failure. NO-Synthase inhibitors seem to abolish 
      toxin-induced priapism. The understanding of the ultimate molecular mechanism 
      involved in toxin-induced priapism may shed light on aspects of erectile 
      function/dysfunction. This study investigates if cavernosal denervation can abolish 
      the toxin-induced priapism. Surgical cavernosal nerve excision/denervation was 
      performed in mice and confirmed by infertility, histological assessment of fibrosis 
      and immunohistochemical staining for synaptophysin. Denervated mice showed intense 
      fibrosis of the cavernosal tissue as well as absence of synaptophysin IHC staining; 
      surprisingly mice showed toxin-induced priapism when tested 15, 30 or 60 days after 
      denervation. While sham-operated mice presented full priapism, denervated animals 
      showed only partial priapism possibly due to the fibrosis. These results reveal that 
      erection caused by Tx2-6 toxin may not depend on cavernosal nerves integrity. The 
      effect of this toxin on sodium channels seem not directly involved in priapism as 
      many toxins have identical effects but do not induce priapism. Discussion approaches 
      the many different potential sites of intervention listed in the signaling cascades 
      of NO/cGMP, RhoA/Rho-Kinase, as well as the emerging new gasotransmitter H(2)S. The 
      pharmacological inhibition of Rho-kinase and toxin Tx2-6 have similar effects 
      in vivo.

AB  - Nigriventrine was isolated from the "armed" spider Phoneutria nigriventer, in which 
      it constitutes about 0.4% of the total venom content. Its structure was determined 
      to be [1,1'-(1-hydroxyhydrazine-1,2-diyl)bis(oxy)bis(4-hydroxy-2,6-dioxopiperidine-4 
      carboxylic acid)] by NMR, HR-ES/IMS and MS/MS methods. The intracerebroventricular 
      application of nigriventrine in rat brain, followed by the detection of c-Fos 
      protein expression, indicated that the compound was neuroactive in the motor cortex, 
      sensory cortex, piriform cortex, median preoptic nucleus, dorsal endopiriform 
      nucleus, lateral septal nucleus and hippocampus of rat brain. Nigriventrine causes 
      convulsions in rats, even when peripherally applied.

AB  - Potassium channels regulate many neuronal functions, including neuronal excitability 
      and synaptic plasticity, contributing, by these means, to mnemonic processes. In 
      particular, A-type K(+) currents (IA) play a key role in hippocampal synaptic 
      plasticity. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the peptidic toxin Tx3-1, a 
      selective blocker of IA currents, extracted from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, on memory of mice. Administration of Tx3-1 (i.c.v., 300 pmol/site) 
      enhanced both short- and long-term memory consolidation of mice tested in the novel 
      object recognition task. In comparison, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; i.c.v., 
      30-300 pmol/site), a non-selective K(+) channel blocker did not alter long-term 
      memory and caused toxic side effects such as circling, freezing and tonic-clonic 
      seizures. Moreover, Tx3-1 (i.c.v., 10-100 pmol/site) restored memory of 
      Aβ25-35-injected mice, and exhibited a higher potency to improve memory of 
      Aβ25-35-injected mice when compared to control group. These results show the effect 
      of the selective blocker of IA currents Tx3-1 in both short- and long-term memory 
      retention and in memory impairment caused by Aβ25-35, reinforcing the role of IA in 
      physiological and pathological memory processes.

TI  - Are Synchronized Changes in Connexin-43 and Caveolin-3 a Bystander Effect in a 
      Phoneutria nigriventer Venom Model of Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown?
PG  - 452-63
LID - 10.1007/s12031-016-0749-0 [doi]
AB  - Upregulation of caveolin-3 (Cav-3) or connexin-43 (Cx43) in astrocytes has been 
      associated with important brain pathologies. We used Phoneutria nigriventer spider 
      venom (PNV), which induces blood-brain barrier breakdown in rats, in order to 
      investigate Cav-3 and Cx43 expression in the cerebellum over critical periods of rat 
      envenomation. By immunofluorescence, western blotting (WB), and transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM), we assessed changes at 1, 2, 5, 24, and 72 h post-venom. 
      WB showed immediate increases in Cav-3 and Cx43 at 1 h (interval of greatest 
      manifestations of envenomation) that persisted at 5 h (when there were signs of 
      recovery) and peaked at 24 h when no signs of envenomation were detectable. At 2 and 
      72 h, Cav-3 was downregulated and Cx43 had returned to baseline. PNV markedly 
      intensified Cx43 in molecular, Purkinje and granular layers and Cav-3 in astrocytes 
      whose colocalization to increased GFAP suggests interaction between reactive 
      astrogliosis and Cav-3 upregulation. TEM showed swollen perivascular astrocytic 
      end-feet and synaptic contact alterations that had generally resolved by 72 h. It is 
      uncertain whether such PNV-induced synchronized changes are an interactive effect 
      between Cav-3 and Cx43, or a bystander effect. Evidences indicate that Cav-3 
      downregulation coupled to Cx43 return to baseline at 72 h when no signs of 
      envenomation were visible, suggesting homeostasis reestablishment. This experimental 
      model is relevant to studying mechanisms involved in neurological disorders 
      associated with Cav-3 overexpression.

TI  - Mechanisms involved in the blood-brain barrier increased permeability induced by 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom in rats.
PG  - 38-47
AB  - We have recently demonstrated by electron microscopy, using lanthanum nitrate as an 
      extracellular tracer, that the intravenous injection of Phoneutria nigriventer 
      spider venom (PNV) induces blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in rat hippocampus. 
      One and nine days after PNV injection, tracer was found in pinocytic vesicles 
      crossing the endothelium and in the interendothelial cleft, suggesting that BBB 
      breakdown had occurred through enhanced transendothelial transport and/or 
      tight-junction opening. In the present work, we investigated the mechanisms by which 
      PNV (850 microg/kg, i.v.) increased the hippocampal microvascular permeability in 
      rats 24 h after the endovenous administration. The expression and phosphorylation of 
      some tight- and adherens junctions-associated proteins in hippocampal homogenate and 
      hippocampal microvessel homogenate were assessed by Western blotting and 
      immunoprecipitation. The microtubule-dependent transcellular transport was also 
      evaluated by quantitative ultrastructural methods in pretreated rats with colchicine 
      (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), prior to PNV injection. Western blots showed no significant 
      increase in the expression of the tight junction-associated proteins ZO-1 and 
      occludin or in the adherens junction-associated beta-catenin after 24 h of PNV 
      administration. Morphological study showed no alterations of the immunolabeling for 
      occludin and ZO-1 in rat brain cryosection following PNV. In addition, no changes 
      were observed in phosphotyrosine content of occludin and beta-catenin in PNV-treated 
      rats compared with control animals. However, the disruption of microtubule-dependent 
      transcellular transport by colchicine completely prevented (p<0.001) PNV-induced 
      leakage of the BBB tracer. These findings indicate that the increased BBB 
      permeability evoked by PNV in rats probably resulted from enhanced 
      microtubule-dependent transendothelial vesicular transport, with no substantial 
      involvement of the paracellular barrier in the time interval studied.

TI  - Role of IgG(T) and IgGa isotypes obtained from arachnidic antivenom to neutralize 
      toxic activities of Loxosceles gaucho, Phoneutria nigriventer and Tityus serrulatus 
      venoms.
PG  - 649-61
AB  - The ability of IgG(T) and IgGa subclasses--isolated by liquid chromatography from 
      equine arachnidic antivenom (AAV)-to neutralize toxic activities of Loxosceles 
      gaucho, Phoneutria nigriventer and Tityus serrulatus venoms as well as to remove 
      venom toxins from circulation was investigated. These subclasses showed similar 
      antibody titers against L. gaucho, P. nigriventer and T. serrulatus venoms, and by 
      immunoblotting few differences were observed in the recognition pattern of venom 
      antigens. IgG(T) and IgGa neutralized 100% lethality induced by L. gaucho and 50% of 
      P. nigriventer venom, but IgGa failed to neutralize T. serrulatus venom, in contrast 
      to IgG(T). Both subclasses neutralized local reactions and dermonecrosis induced by 
      L. gaucho venom in rabbits. In mice, IgG(T) and IgGa partially neutralized the 
      edematogenic activity induced by P. nigriventer and T. serrulatus venoms, but only 
      IgG(T) neutralized (ca. 81%) the nociceptive activity induced by T. serrulatus 
      venom. Both subclasses failed to neutralize nociceptive activity induced by P. 
      nigriventer venom. IgG(T) reduced the serum venom levels of animals injected with L. 
      gaucho, P. nigriventer or T. serrulatus venoms, while IgGa solely reduced L. gaucho 
      and P. nigriventer venoms levels. Our results demostrate that IgG(T) and IgGa 
      subclasses neutralize toxic activities induced by P. nigriventer, T. serrulatus and 
      L. gaucho venoms with different efficacies, as well as depurate these venoms from 
      circulation.

TI  - Ctenus medius and Phoneutria nigriventer spiders venoms share noxious 
      proinflammatory activities.
PG  - 58-66
AB  - Ctenus medius Keyserling, 1891 (Araneae: Ctenidae) co-occurs in various 
      microhabitats of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and can be easily misidentified as 
      the medically important spider Phoneutria nigriventer Keyserling, 1981 (Ctenidae). 
      Despite being phylogenetically close to Phoneutria, no data are available about the 
      toxic potential of Ctenus medius venom. Here we show that, although presenting 
      different profile of protein composition, C. medius venom displays some of the toxic 
      properties exhibited by P. nigriventer venom, including proteolytic, hyaluronidasic 
      and phospholipasic activities, as well as the ability of causing hyperalgesia and 
      edema. Moreover, C. medius venom interferes in the activation of the complement 
      system in concentrations that P. nigriventer venom is inactive. Thus, these data 
      show that venoms of spiders from Ctenidae family share important proinflammatory 
      properties and suggest that the C. medius bite may have an important noxious effect 
      in human accidents.

TI  - PnTx4-3, a new insect toxin from Phoneutria nigriventer venom elicits the glutamate 
      uptake inhibition exhibited by PhTx4 toxic fraction.
PG  - 793-800
AB  - Several pools of neurotoxic peptides obtained from fractionated Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom induce different toxicological effects. One of them, PhTx4, is 
      highly toxic towards insects and displays only a slight toxicity when injected in 
      mice. Also, this fraction contains a class of peptides that are able to inhibit 
      glutamate uptake in preparations of mammalian central nervous systems (CNS). In this 
      work a new toxin called PnTx4-3 was isolated from the PhTx4 fraction by reverse 
      phase and anion exchange steps using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
      Edman sequencing of PnTx4-3 revealed that it was a polypeptide of 48 amino acid 
      residues, containing 10 cysteines cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. The 
      molecular mass measured by ES-Q-TOF mass spectrometry was 5199.49+/-0.64 Da, which 
      is very close to the calculated mass from amino acid sequence (5199.99 Da). This 
      toxin induces immediate excitatory effects when injected intrathoracically in house 
      flies and cockroaches. Intracerebroventricular injections of 30 microg of PnTx4-3 in 
      mice resulted in no apparent signs of intoxication. In order to make an orthologous 
      comparison, pharmacological characterisation were carried out in rat brain 
      synaptosomes by using [3H]-L-glutamate, showed that the whole PhTx4 fraction as well 
      as the pure toxins PnTx4-3, Tx4(6-1) and Tx4(5-5) obtained of this fraction, were 
      able to inhibit the glutamate uptake in the micromolar concentration range. PnTx4-3 
      inhibits the glutamate uptake in a dose dependent manner, with an IC50 of 
      approximately 1 microM. PnTx4-3 is highly homologous to the Tx4(6-1) and Tx4(5-5) 
      toxins previously described from the same fraction.

TI  - Peripheral tackykinin and excitatory amino acid receptors mediate hyperalgesia 
      induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom.
PG  - 111-8
AB  - The generation of hyperalgesia by Phoneutria nigriventer venom was investigated in 
      rats using the paw pressure test, through the intraplantar injection of the venom. 
      Hyperalgesia was significantly inhibited by N-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) 
      ethyl]-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-2H-2-benzazepine-2-carbothioamide 
      (capsazepine), a vanilloid receptor antagonist, by the local administration of 
      pGlu-Ala-Asp-Pro-Asn-Lys-Phe-Tyr-Pro (spiro-gamma-lactam) Leu-Trp-NH(2) (GR82334) or 
      of Phenyl-CO-Ala-Ala-D-Trp-Phe-D-Pro-Pro-Nle-NH(2) (GR94800), inhibitors of 
      tachykinin NK(1) and NK(2) receptors, respectively, or by the local injection of 
      dizocilpine (MK 801), (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid ((+/-)-AP-5), or 
      6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), antagonists of NMDA and non-NMDA 
      excitatory amino acid receptors. The correlation between hyperalgesia and the 
      inflammatory response induced by the venom was also investigated. The venom-induced 
      edematogenic response was not modified by the pharmacological treatments. These 
      results suggest that hyperalgesia induced by P. nigriventer venom is mediated by 
      stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive neurons, with activation of peripheral tachykinin 
      NK(1) and NK(2) receptors and of both the NMDA and AMPA receptors. Distinct 
      mechanisms are involved in the development of hyperalgesia and edema induced by the 
      venom.

TI  - Purification and amino acid sequences of six Tx3 type neurotoxins from the venom of 
      the Brazilian 'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer (Keys).
PG  - 35-42
AB  - Six neurotoxic peptides (Tx3-1 to Tx3-6) were purified from the venom of the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer by a combination of gel filtration, reverse phase FPLC on 
      PEP-RPC and PRO-RPC columns, reverse phase HPLC on Vydac C18, and ion exchange HPLC 
      on cationic and anionic columns. These toxins caused different neurological symptoms 
      in mice after intracerebroventricular injection. At dose levels of 5 
      micrograms/mouse, Tx3-3 and Tx3-4 caused rapid general flaccid paralysis followed by 
      death in 10-30 min; Tx3-2 induced immediate clockwise gyration and flaccid paralysis 
      after 6 hr; Tx3-1, Tx3-5 and Tx3-6 produced paralysis only in the posterior limbs 
      and gradual decreases in movement and aggression during 24 hr. The mol. wt of these 
      cystine-rich peptides were found to be in the range of 3500-8500 by mass 
      spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. The complete amino acid sequences of the neurotoxins 
      Tx3-1 (40 residues), Tx3-2 (34 residues) and Tx3-6 (55 residues), and the N-terminal 
      sequences of Tx3-3 (34 res.), Tx3-4 (40 res.) and Tx3-5 (36 res.) were established 
      by direct automated Edman degradation, and manual DABITC/PITC microsequence analyses 
      of peptides obtained from digests with various proteases. The structures of these 
      Tx3 neurotoxins from Phoneutria nigriventer exhibited sequence similarities to one 
      another and to the neurotoxins from the venoms of the spiders Hololena curta and 
      Agelenopsis aperta, which were most evident in the location of the Cys residues.

TI  - Purification and amino acid sequence of a highly insecticidal toxin from the venom 
      of the brazilian spider Phoneutria nigriventer which inhibits NMDA-evoked currents 
      in rat hippocampal neurones.
PG  - 309-17
AB  - A new insecticidal toxin Tx4(5-5) was isolated from the fraction PhTx4 of the venom 
      of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer by reverse phase high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) and anion exchange HPLC. The complete amino acid sequence 
      determined by automated Edman degradation showed that Tx4(5-5) is a single chain 
      polypeptide composed of 47 amino acid residues, including 10 cysteines, with a 
      calculated molecular mass of 5175 Da. Tx4(5-5) shows 64% of sequence identity with 
      Tx4(6-1), another insecticidal toxin from the same venom. Tx4(5-5) was highly toxic 
      to house fly (Musca domestica), cockroach (Periplaneta americana) and cricket 
      (Acheta domesticus ), producing neurotoxic effects (knock-down, trembling with 
      uncoordinated movements) at doses as low as 50 ng/g (house fly), 250 ng/g 
      (cockroach) and 150 ng/g (cricket). In contrast, intracerebroventricular injections 
      (30 microg) into mice induced no behavioural effects. Preliminary 
      electrophysiological studies carried out on whole-cell voltage-clamped rat 
      hippocampal neurones indicated that Tx4(5-5) (at 1 microM) reversibly inhibited the 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate-subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor, while having little 
      or no effect on kainate-, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid- 
      or gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated currents.

TI  - The Phoneutria nigriventer spider toxin, PnTx4-5-5, promotes neuronal survival by 
      blocking NMDA receptors.

AB  - Spider toxins are recognized as useful sources of bioactive substances, showing a 
      wide range of pharmacological effects on neurotransmission. Several spider toxins 
      have been identified biochemically and some of them are specific glutamate receptors 
      antagonists. Previous data indicate that PnTx4-5-5, a toxin isolated from the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, inhibits the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), with 
      little or no effect on AMPA, kainate or GABA receptors. In agreement with these 
      results, our findings in this study show that PnTx4-5-5 reduces the amplitude of 
      NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in hippocampal slices. It is well established that 
      glutamate-mediated excitotoxic neuronal cell death occurs mainly via NMDAR 
      activation. Thus, we decided to investigate whether PnTx4-5-5 would protect against 
      various cell death insults. For that, we used primary-cultured corticostriatal 
      neurons from wild type (WT) mice, as well as from a mouse model of Huntington's 
      disease, BACHD. Our results showed that PnTx4-5-5 promotes neuroprotection of WT and 
      BACHD neurons under the insult of high levels of glutamate. Moreover, the toxin is 
      also able to protect WT neurons against amyloid β (Aβ) peptide toxicity. These 
      results indicate that the toxin PnTx4-5-5 is a potential neuroprotective drug.

PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Phoneutria (Ctenidae) is among the most dangerous venomous spiders in Brazil. Its 
      venom is composed of a mixture of pharmacologically active components, some of which 
      have been quite extensively studied due to their potentiality as models for new 
      pharmaceutical drugs. Nevertheless, literature data on the venom-producing glands 
      are very limited. In the present study, we follow the biological development of 
      intra-cocoon stages of Phoneutria nigriventer spiders, mainly regarding the 
      formation of the venomous apparatus and venom production. The results showed that 
      the venom glands of Phoneutria are already present in the early 1st pre-larva stage. 
      The venomous apparatus is completely formed in the larva, a stage that precedes the 
      spider eclosion from the cocoon. At embryo stages, transcripts of a 
      vertebrate-active neurotoxin (PhTx1) were shown to be present, as well as, 
      unidentified venom proteins that were immunolabeled by anti-venom antibodies. It 
      seems that venom toxins play roles in the protection and survival of those early 
      developmental stages of Phoneutria spiders.

TI  - Expression of VEGF and Flk-1 and Flt-1 receptors during blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      impairment following Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom exposure.
PG  - 2572-88
LID - 10.3390/toxins5122572 [doi]
AB  - Apart from its angiogenic and vascular permeation activity, the vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) has been also reported as a potent neuronal protector. Newborn 
      rats with low VEGF levels develop neuron degeneration, while high levels induce 
      protective mechanisms in several neuropathological conditions. Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom (PNV) disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and causes 
      neuroinflammation in central neurons along with excitotoxic signals in rats and 
      humans. All these changes are transient. Herein, we examined the expression of VEGF 
      and its receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1 in the hippocampal neurons following envenomation 
      by PNV. Adult and neonatal rats were evaluated at time limits of 2, 5 and 24 h. 
      Additionally, BBB integrity was assessed by measuring the expression of occludin, 
      β-catenin and laminin and neuron viability was evaluated by NeuN expression. VEGF, 
      Flt-1 and Flk-1 levels increased in PNV-administered rats, concurrently with 
      respective mRNAs. Flt-1 and Flk-1 immunolabeling was nuclear in neurons of 
      hippocampal regions, instead of the VEGF membrane-bound typical location. These 
      changes occurred simultaneously with the transient decreases in BBB-associated 
      proteins and NeuN positivity. Adult rats showed more prominent expressional 
      increases of the VEGF/Flt-1/Flk-1 system and earlier recovery of BBB-related 
      proteins than neonates. We conclude that the reactive expressional changes seen here 
      suggest that VEGF and receptors could have a role in the excitotoxic mechanism of 
      PNV and that such role would be less efficient in neonate rats.

AB  - Animal venoms are an almost inexhaustible source for promising molecules with 
      biological activity and the venom of Phoneutria nigriventer spider is a good example 
      of this. Among several other toxins obtained from this venom, PnTx4(6-1), also 
      called δ-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a, was isolated and initially described as an insect toxin 
      that binds to the site 3 of sodium channels in cockroach nerve cord synaptosomes 
      (Periplaneta americana) and slows down sodium current inactivation in isolated axons 
      of this animal. This toxin did not cause any apparent toxicity to mice when 
      intracerebroventricularly injected (30 μg). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that 
      PnTx4(6-1) has an antinociceptive effect in three different pain models: 
      inflammatory, induced by carrageenan; nociceptive, induced by prostaglandin E(2) and 
      neuropathic, induced by sciatic nerve constriction. Using diverse antagonists from 
      receptors, it was shown that the cannabinoid system, via the CB(1) receptor, and the 
      opioid system, through the μ and δ receptors, are both involved in the 
      antinociceptive effect of PnTx4(6-1). In the present work, it was synthesized a 
      peptide, named PnAn13, based on the amino acid sequence of PnTx4(6-1) in order to 
      try to reproduce or increase the analgesic effect of the toxin. As it was seen for 
      the toxin, PnAn13 had antinociceptive activity, when intrathecally injected, and 
      this effect involved the cannabinoid and opioid systems. In addition, when it was 
      evaluated the peripheral effect of PnAn13, via intraplantar administration, this 
      peptide was able to reverse the hyperalgesic threshold, evoked by prostaglandin 
      E(2). Therefore, using different pharmacological tools, it was shown the 
      participation of cannabinoid and opioid systems in this effect.

TI  - c-FOS and n-NOS reactive neurons in response to circulating Phoneutria nigriventer 
      spider venom.
PG  - 114-26
AB  - Drugs and neurotoxins activate specific neural circuits by increasing or decreasing 
      the formation and release of neurotransmitters, such as nitric oxide (NO), and by 
      inducing immediate early genes, such as FOS. We have previously shown that 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) impairs the microtubule-dependent 
      transcellular barrier of the blood-brain interface and causes structural alterations 
      in perivascular astrocytic end-feet without producing morphological changes in 
      central neuronal cells. In the present study, we used FOS and neuronal nitric oxide 
      synthase (n-NOS) immunolabeling to investigate the ability of PNV to activate the 
      central nervous system. Three groups of rats were used: the first group received a 
      sublethal dose of PNV (850 microg/kg, via a tail vein), the second received an equal 
      volume of 0.9% saline (sham group) and the third group received no injection. 
      Envenomed rats showed salivation, lachrymation, tremors and flaccidity followed by 
      spastic paralysis of the hind limbs and convulsions. Cryosections (30 microm thick) 
      were serially collected at 600 microm intervals for free-floating 
      immunohistochemical analysis. FOS-like positive neurons predominated in 
      motor-related areas such as dorsolateral (dlPAG) and ventral periaqueductal gray 
      matter (vPAG), frontal (FCM) and parietal motor cortex (PCM), and periventricular 
      thalamic nucleus (PTN) and in acute stress-related areas (rhinal cortex and lateral 
      septal nuclei). The greatest relative increases in FOS-like positive neurons 
      occurred in the vPAG, PCM and PTN motor-related areas. n-NOS-positive neurons 
      predominated in the periventricular thalamic nuclei, followed by the dorsolateral 
      periaqueductal gray matter and parietal cortex motor area. The marked activation of 
      motor areas and, to a lesser extent, of acute stress-related areas suggested the 
      involvement of neuronal pathways in these regions in the response to envenoming by 
      PNV. In addition, the occurrence of n-NOS immunolabeling in some anatomical regions 
      with FOS-like positive neurons suggests that NO may modulate the response to PNV in 
      these regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom contains several cysteine-rich 
      peptide toxins that act on different ion channels. Despite extensive studies on its 
      venom and description of cDNA sequences of several of its toxin precursors, the gene 
      structure of these toxins remains unknown. METHODS: Genomic regions encoding the 
      precursors of three previously characterized P. nigriventer toxins - PnTx1, PnTx2-5 
      and PnTx4(5-5) - were amplified by PCR using specific primers. PCR fragments were 
      cloned and sequenced. Obtained sequences were compared with their corresponding cDNA 
      sequences. RESULTS: The size of PCR fragments obtained and sequences corresponding 
      to genomic regions encoding for the toxin precursors matched their cDNA sequences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite a few nucleotide substitutions in the genomic regions encoding 
      for the toxin precursors when compared with cDNA sequences, the results of the 
      present work indicate that P. nigriventer toxins do not contain introns in their 
      genes sequences.

TI  - The effect of a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, SR140333, on oedema formation 
      induced in rat skin by venom from the Phoneutria nigriventer spider.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - 1. The possibility that tachykinin NK1 receptors are involved in the plasma 
      extravasation evoked by intradermal (i.d.) injection of Phoneutria nigriventer venom 
      (PNV) in rat dorsal skin in vivo has been investigated. 2. Local oedema formation 
      induced by the i.d. injection of test agents was measured by the extravascular 
      accumulation of intravenously (i.v.) injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin over 
      a 30 min period. 3. The tachykinin NK1 agonist, GR73632 (30 pmol per site), induced 
      local oedema formation which was potentiated by co-injection with the neuropeptide 
      vasodilator, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, 10 pmol per site). The 
      non-peptide tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, SR140333 (0.03-1 nmol per site 
      co-injected, i.d.) significantly inhibited (0.3 nmol per site, P < 0.05; 1 nmol per 
      site, P < 0.001) local oedema formation induced by GR73632 with CGRP but not that 
      induced by histamine (10 nmol per site) with CGRP. 4. PNV (0.03-0.3 microgram per 
      site) injected i.d. induced dose-dependent local oedema formation. SR140333 (1 nmol 
      per site, co-injected i.d.) inhibited oedema formation; with complete inhibition 
      observed at doses of 0.03 microgram (P < 0.05) and 0.1 microgram (P < 0.001); and 
      partial inhibition (50%) observed with the highest dose of PNV, 0.3 microgram (P < 
      0.05). 5. Local oedema formation induced by PNV was not affected by systemic 
      pretreatment with the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (80 nmol kg-1, 
      i.v.), which was used at a dose which significantly inhibited oedema formation by 
      bradykinin (1 nmol per site). 6. Local oedema formation induced by PNV was 
      significantly inhibited (P < 0.01) by co-injection of the histamine H1 receptor 
      antagonist, mepyramine (2.5 nmol per site), together with the 5-hydroxytryptamine 
      (5-HT) antagonist, methysergide (2.8 nmol per site). 7. In the presence of all three 
      antagonists (mepyramine 2.5 nmol per site; methysergide, 2.8 nmol per site and 
      SR140333 1 nmol per site), the plasma extravasation induced by PNV was further 
      significantly inhibited (P < 0.001, when compared with PNV injected i.d. alone; P < 
      0.05 when compared with PNV co-injected with mepyramine and methysergide and P < 
      0.01, when compared with PNV co-injected with SR140333). 8. These results suggest 
      that oedema formation evoked by i.d. PNV in rat skin may be partially mediated via a 
      mechanism involving tachykinin NK1 receptors and that this effect is independent of 
      histamine and 5-HT.

TI  - VEGF/VEGFR-2 system exerts neuroprotection against Phoneutria nigriventer spider 
      envenomation through PI3K-AKT-dependent pathway.
PG  - 76-90
LID - S0041-0101(20)30298-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.06.019 [doi]
AB  - This study was undertaken to elucidate why VEGF/VEGFR-2 is elevated in the 
      hippocampus of rats injected with Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV). PNV 
      delays Na(+) channels inactivation; blocks Ca(2+) and K(+) channels, increases 
      glutamate release, causes blood-brain breakdown (BBBb), brain edema and severe 
      excitotoxicity. Analytical FT-IR spectroscopy showed profound alteration in 
      molecular biochemical state, with evidences for VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) signaling 
      mediation. By blocking VEGF/VEGFR-2 binding via pre-treatment with itraconazole we 
      demonstrated that animals' condition was deteriorated soon at 1-2 h post-PNV 
      exposure concurrently with decreased expression of VEGF, BBB-associated proteins, 
      ZO-1, β-catenin, laminin, P-gp (P-glycoprotein), Neu-N (neuron's viability marker) 
      and MAPKphosphorylated-p38, while phosphorylated-ERK and Src pathways were 
      increased. At 5 h and coinciding with incipient signs of animals' recuperation, the 
      proteins associated with protection (HIF-1α, VEGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, Neu-N, 
      occludin, β-catenin, laminin, P-gp efflux protein, phosphorylated-p38) increased 
      thus indicating p38 pathway activation together with paracellular route 
      strengthening. However, the BBB transcellular trafficking and caspase-3 increased 
      (pro-apoptotic pathway activation). At 24 h, the transcellular route reestablished 
      physiological state but the pro-survival pathway PI3K/(p-Akt) dropped in animals 
      underwent VEGF/VEGFR-2 binding inhibition, whereas it was significantly activated at 
      matched interval in PNV group without prior itraconazole; these results demonstrate 
      impaired VEGF' survival effects at 24 h. The inhibition of VEGF/VEGFR-2 binding 
      identified 5 h as turning point at which multi-level dynamic interplay was elicited 
      to reverse hippocampal damage. Collectively, the data confirmed VEGFR-2 signaling 
      via serine-threonine kinase Akt as neuroprotective pathway against PNV-induced 
      damage. Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms underlying PNV effects.

TI  - The purification and amino acid sequences of four Tx2 neurotoxins from the venom of 
      the Brazilian 'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer (Keys).
PG  - 153-6
AB  - Four neurotoxic polypeptides (Tx2-1, Txt2-5, Tx2-6 and Tx2-9) were purified from the 
      venom of the South American 'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer (Keys) by gel 
      filtration and reverse phase FPLC and HPLC. These cysteine-rich polypeptides 
      exhibited different levels of neurotoxicity in mice after intracerebroventricular 
      injection. Tx2-1, Tx2-5 and Tx2-6 caused spastic paralysis and death, but the less 
      toxic Tx2-9 produced only tail erection and scratching. The molecular weights of the 
      polypeptides as determined by desorption mass spectroscoopy were 5838.8 for Tx2-1, 
      5116.6 (Tx2-5), 5291.3 (Tx2-6) and 3742.1 (Tx2-9). The complete amino acid sequences 
      of the neurotoxins were determined by automated Edman degradation and by manual 
      DABITC-PITC microsequence analysis of peptides obtained after digestions with 
      various proteases. The amino acid sequences of Tx2-1 (53 residues), Tx2-5 (49 
      residues) and Tx2-6 (48 residues) were homologous, but had only limited similarities 
      to the less toxic Tx2-9 (32 residues). All four polypeptides had varying sequence 
      identities with other neurotoxins from different spider species and biologically 
      active peptides from scorpions, a sea snail and seeds of Mirabilis jalapa.

TI  - Antiarrhythmogenic effects of a neurotoxin from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 217-24
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.11.013 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effects of PhKv, a 4584 Da peptide isolated from the 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer venom, in the isolated rat heart and in isolated 
      ventricular myocytes. Ventricular arrhythmias were induced by occlusion of the left 
      anterior descending coronary artery for 15 min followed by 30 min of reperfusion. 
      Administration of native PhKv (240 nM) 1 min before or after reperfusion markedly 
      reduced the duration of arrhythmias. This effect was blocked by atropine, thereby 
      indicating the participation of muscarinic receptors in the antiarrhythmogenic 
      effect of PhKv. Notably, recombinant PhKv (240 nM) was also efficient to attenuate 
      the arrhythmias (3.8 ± 0.9 vs. 8.0 ± 1.2 arbitrary units in control group). 
      Furthermore, PhKv induced a significant reduction in heart rate. This bradycardia 
      was partially blunted by atropine and potentiated by pyridostigmine. To further 
      evaluate the participation of acetylcholine on the PhKv effects, we examined the 
      release of this neurotransmitter from neuromuscular junctions. It was found that 
      Phkv (200 nM) significantly increased the release of acetylcholine in this 
      preparation. Moreover, PhKv (250 nM) did not cause any significant change in action 
      potential or Ca(2+) transient parameters in isolated cardiomyocytes. Altogether, 
      these findings show an important acetylcholine-mediated antiarrhythmogenic effect of 
      the spider PhKv toxin in isolated hearts.

TI  - Promiscuous and reversible blocker of presynaptic calcium channels in frog and 
      crayfish neuromuscular junctions from Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 3529-37
AB  - Peptide channel blockers found in venoms of many predators are useful 
      pharmacological tools and potential therapeutic agents. The venom of the Brazilian 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer contains a fraction, omega-phonetoxin-IIA 
      (omega-Ptx-IIA, 8360 MW), which blocks Ca2+ channels. At frog neuromuscular 
      junctions (NMJ) bathed in normal Ca2+ (1.8 mM) saline, omega-Ptx IIA did not affect 
      spontaneous transmitter release but reversibly reduced evoked transmitter release by 
      75 and 95% at 12 and 24 nM, respectively. In contrast, toxin effects were 
      irreversible in low-Ca2+ (0.5 mM) saline. Ca2+ imaging in normal-Ca2+ saline showed 
      that omega-Ptx-IIA partially blocked stimulus-dependent presynaptic Ca2+ signals, 
      and the blockade was almost completely reversible. Increases in spontaneous release 
      frequency induced by high extracellular K+ were blocked by omega-Ptx-IIA. Therefore 
      omega-Ptx-IIA blocks N-type Ca2+ channels, which admit Ca2+ that triggers 
      transmitter release at the frog NMJ. Additional evidence predicts that omega-Ptx-IIA 
      binds to N-type Ca2+ channels at a different site from that of omega-Conotoxin-GVIA. 
      omega-Ptx-IIA also gave a low-affinity partial blockade of transmitter release and 
      presynaptic Ca2+ signals at crayfish NMJs where P-type channels are blocked by 
      omega-agatoxin-IVA. The Ca2+-dependent reversibility and promiscuity of this toxin 
      may make it highly useful experimentally and therapeutically.

TI  - Role of Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle contractions induced by Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 61-8
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer venom (PNV) contracts vascular tissues and increases arterial 
      blood pressure. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved on 
      PNV-induced contractions of rabbit mesenteric and celiac arteries. Strips of 
      mesenteric and celiac arteries were suspended in a cascade system and superfused 
      with warmed and oxygenated Krebs solution. PNV was dialyzed in order to exclude the 
      participation of biogenic amines in the contractions elicited by the venom. 
      Noradrenaline (NA, 30-300 pmol), PNV (1-10 microg), Bay K-8644 (0.3-3 nmol) and KCl 
      (10-100 micromol) dose-dependently contracted the preparations. Ca(2+)-free solution 
      reduced by 38 and 83% the PNV-induced contractions of mesenteric and celiac 
      arteries, respectively. Subsequent infusion of EGTA (0.2 mM) suppressed the residual 
      contractions. Nifedipine (1 microM) and verapamil (10 microM) abolished PNV- and Bay 
      K-8644-evoked contractions, whereas those induced by NA were reduced to a lesser 
      extent. Lanthanum chloride (0.2 mM) inhibited by 75-90% the mesenteric and celiac 
      contractions mediated by PNV. Caffeine (2 mM) fully blocked contractions induced by 
      NA (95% mean inhibition), but only partly reduced those induced by PNV (35% mean 
      inhibition). Ryanodine (10 microM) inhibited by 50% the contractions evoked by NA, 
      but had no effect on the PNV-induced contractions in both tissues. Our findings 
      indicate that PNV contracts vascular smooth muscle mainly due to increased influx of 
      Ca(2+) from extracellular sources.

TI  - Blockade of acetylcholine release at the motor endplate by a polypeptide from the 
      venom of Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 2817-23
AB  - 1. The mechanisms underlying the muscle relaxation effect of a fraction (PF3) 
      isolated from the Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom were assessed on mouse 
      diaphragm and chick biventer cervicis muscle preparations. 2. PF3 (0.25-4 micrograms 
      ml-1) produced a concentration-dependent blockade of the nerve-elicited muscle 
      twitch of the mouse diaphragm (IC50 = 0.8 micrograms ml-1) without affecting the 
      directly induced muscle twitch. In similar preparations, the crude venom (1-10 
      micrograms ml-1) produced muscle contracture and blocked both the direct and 
      indirectly induced muscle twitches. 3. In the chick biventer cervicis muscle, PF3 
      (1-5 micrograms ml-1) blocked the nerve stimulated muscle twitch (IC50 = 1.26 
      micrograms ml-1), but did not alter the postjunctional response to exogenous 
      acetylcholine (ACh, 10 microM-10 mM). 4. PF3 (2-8 micrograms ml-1) reduced the 
      frequency of miniature endplate potentials (m.e.p.ps) recorded intracellularly from 
      the mouse diaphragm muscle fibers by 58 to 64%, and diminished the amplitude of 
      m.e.p.ps by 20 to 40% of control. The relationship between log m.e.p.p. frequency 
      and log [Ca2+]o was shifted rightwards in the presence of 4 micrograms ml-1 PF3. 5. 
      Raising the frequency of m.e.p.ps with high K+ medium or theophylline (3 mM) did not 
      prevent the toxin-induced depression of spontaneous ACh release. 6. The quantal 
      content of e.p.ps (m), determined in cut-diaphragm muscle fibres, was reduced by 53% 
      and 77% of control by 1 and 4 micrograms ml-1 PF3, respectively. At 1 microgram ml-1 
      the toxin shifted the relationship between log m and log [Ca2+]o towards higher 
      values without apparent change of the slope. 7. E.p.p. trains elicited at 10 to 50 
      Hz in the presence of PF3 (1 microgram ml-1) exhibited irregular amplitudes and 
      facilitation related to the frequency of nerve stimulation. 8. It is concluded that 
      PF3 blocks neuromuscular transmission by acting prejunctionally and reducing the 
      nerve-evoked transmitter release. The effect was related to a diminished Ca2+ entry 
      into the nerve terminal associated with inhibition of exocytosis.

TI  - Isolation of a polypeptide from Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom responsible for 
      the increased vascular permeability in rabbit skin.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - Fractionation of Phoneutria nigriventer venom by Sephadex G-10 followed by 
      ion-exchange chromatography yields a fraction (fraction XIII) which increases 
      microvascular permeability in rabbit skin in vivo by activating the tissue 
      kallikrein-kinin system. One polypeptide (PNV3) with the ability to increase 
      microvascular permeability in the rabbit skin in vivo was isolated from fraction 
      XIII and biochemically characterized. PNV3 has 132 amino acid residues with a 
      calculated mol. wt of 14,475. This polypeptide showed the following N-terminal 
      sequence: AVFAIQDQPC. Amino acid analysis indicated the presence of six disulfide 
      bridges and a high content of Glx (20%). Pairwise comparison of PNV3 amino acid 
      sequence with 27 other spider venom polypeptides and proteins indicated that PNV3 
      presents high similarity (60-70%) with other toxins (Tx2.1, Tx2.5 and Tx2.6) 
      isolated from P. nigriventer venom.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer omega-phonetoxin IIA blocks the Cav2 family of calcium 
      channels and interacts with omega-conotoxin-binding sites.
PG  - 13856-62
AB  - omega-Phonetoxin IIA (omegaPtxIIA), a peptide from spider venom (Phoneutria 
      nigriventer), inhibits high threshold voltage-dependent calcium currents in neurons. 
      To define its pharmacological specificity, we have used patch-clamp methods in cell 
      lines expressing recombinant Ca(v)2.1, Ca(v)2.2, and Ca(v)2.3 channels (P/Q-, N-, 
      and R-type currents, respectively). Calcium currents generated by Ca(v)2.1 and 
      Ca(v)2.2 were blocked almost irreversibly by 3 nm omegaPtxIIA, whereas Ca(v)2.3 
      showed partial and readily reversible inhibition. Binding assays with 
      mono[(125)I]iodo-omegaPtxIIA indicated that membranes expressing recombinant 
      Ca(v)2.1 or Ca(v)2.2 channels showed a single class of sites with similar affinity 
      (K(D) approximately 50 pm), whereas low affinity interactions were detectable with 
      Ca(v)2.3. Kinetic, saturation, and displacement assays demonstrated that rat brain 
      synaptosomes displayed multiple classes of binding sites for (125)I-omegaPtxIIA. 
      High affinity binding of (125)I-omegaPtxIIA was totally displaced by omegaPtxIIA 
      (K(i) = 100 pm), but only partially by omega-conotoxin GVIA (25% inhibition) and 
      omega-conotoxin MVIIC (50% inhibition at 0.3 microm). (125)I-omegaPtxIIA thus 
      defines a unique high affinity binding site that is predominantly associated with 
      Ca(v)2.1 or Ca(v)2.2 channels.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer toxin 1: a novel, state-dependent inhibitor of neuronal 
      sodium channels that interacts with micro conotoxin binding sites.
PG  - 1931-7
AB  - A toxin was purified to homogeneity from the venom of the South American armed 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer and found to have a molecular mass of 8600 Da and a 
      C-terminally amidated glycine residue. It appears to be identical to Toxin 1 (Tx1) 
      isolated previously from this venom. Tx1 reversibly inhibited sodium currents in 
      Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant sodium (Na(v)1.2) channels 
      without affecting their fast biophysical properties. The kinetics of inhibition of 
      peak sodium current varied with membrane potential, with on-rates increasing and 
      off-rates decreasing with more depolarized holding potentials in the -100 to -50 mV 
      range. Thus, the apparent affinity of Tx1 for the channel increases as the membrane 
      is depolarized. A mono[(125)I]iodo-Tx1 derivative displayed high-affinity binding to 
      a single class of sites (K(D) = 80 pM, B(max) = 0.43 pmol/mg protein) in rat brain 
      membranes. Solubilized binding sites were immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed 
      against a conserved motif in sodium channel alpha subunits. (125)I-Tx1 binding was 
      competitively displaced by mu conotoxin GIIIB (IC(50) = 0.5 microM) but not by 1 
      microM tetrodotoxin. However, the inhibition of (125)I-Tx1 binding by mu conotoxin 
      GIIIB was abrogated in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM). Patch-clamp and 
      binding data indicate that P. nigriventer Tx1 is a novel, state-dependent 
      sodium-channel blocker that binds to a site in proximity to pharmacological site 1, 
      overlapping mu conotoxin but not tetrodotoxin binding sites.

TI  - Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and neuropathological changes induced by 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is responsible for selective flux of substances 
      between blood and brain. The selective permeability of the BBB is crucial for the 
      maintenance of the brain microenvironment homeostasis, and alterations in the 
      barrier may be involved in many pathophysiological processes. Phoneutria nigriventer 
      armed spider venom produces excitatory signals and symptoms in humans, and its 
      recognized neurotoxic action suggests a potential ability to alter BBB permeability. 
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the capacity of P. nigriventer venom 
      (PNV) in promoting BBB breakdown in adult rats. After intravenous injection of 850 
      micro g/kg of the whole venom, BBB lesions were evaluated after 18 h to 9 days by 
      ultrastructural methods using the extracellular tracer lanthanum nitrate. Clinical 
      signs and symptoms of rats showed acute neurotoxicity, with some of the animals 
      presenting convulsions, but which were clinically resolved by 12 h post-envenoming. 
      The results showed that PNV is able to increase BBB permeability, particularly in 
      the hippocampus. Changes were first detected in arterioles and post-capillary 
      venules 18 h to 5 days after venom inoculation. The increased permeation of the 
      extracellular tracer peaked on day 1, representing about 42% of the examined vessels 
      (P<0.01). This appeared to occur by both transendothelial and intercellular routes, 
      i.e., by pinocytic transport and through interendothelial junctions. Concomitantly, 
      the surrounding tissue showed vasogenic edema and swollen astrocytic processes, 
      without inflammatory infiltrates. The peak of the edema occurrence was observed on 
      day 3, in about 60% of the vessels (P<0.001). Enhanced capillary permeability was 
      observed on day 9, and affected 36% of all capillaries (P<0.05). The affected 
      capillaries were characterized by increased number of pinocytotic vesicles, which, 
      in addition, were filled with the extracellular tracer, but without visible 
      transport through the interendothelial pathway. This study demonstrates that 
      systemic PNV inoculation induces BBB breakdown through trans- and paracellular 
      routes. It is concluded that BBB breakdown is an event not associated with the acute 
      neurotoxicity exhibited by the rats.

TI  - Purification and amino acid sequence of the insecticidal neurotoxin Tx4(6-1) from 
      the venom of the 'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer (Keys).
PG  - 83-93
AB  - An insecticidal peptide referred to as Tx4(6-1) was purified from the venom of the 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer by a combination of gel filtration, reverse-phase fast 
      liquid chromatography on Pep-RPC, reverse-phase high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) on Vydac C18 and ion-exchange HPLC on cationic columns. 
      Tx4(6-1) is highly toxic to house flies. At levels of 0.5 ng/house fly it caused 
      excitatory symptoms immediately after intrathoracical injection. However, in mice 
      injections of 0.03 mg of the toxin intracerebroventricularly resulted in no apparent 
      symptoms of intoxication. These results demonstrate that Tx4(6-1) of P. nigriventer 
      has no toxicity for mice, and suggest that it is a specific anti-insect toxin. The 
      mol. wt (5244.6) and purity of the toxin were determined by desorption mass 
      spectroscopy. The complete amino acid sequence of this toxin was established by 
      direct automated Edman degradation and manual 
      4-N,N'-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'isothiocyanate/phenyl-isothiocyanate microsequence 
      analyses of peptides obtained from digests with various proteases. The protein 
      contains 48 amino acids including 10 Cys and 6 Lys. The N-terminal and C-terminal 
      residues were Cys. The Tx4(6-1) sequence differs from that of previously 
      characterized neurotoxins found in the same and other venom spiders, but exhibited 
      sequence similarities in the location of the Cys residues.

      often lead to resistance to current therapy. Animal toxins have been used as 
      pharmacological tools to study penile erection. Human accidents involving the venom 
      of Phoneutria nigriventer spider are characterized by priapism. We hypothesize that 
      PnTx2-6 potentiates cavernosal relaxation in diabetic mice by increasing cyclic 
      guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This effect is neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) 
      dependent. Cavernosal strips were contracted with phenylephrine (10(-5) M) and 
      relaxed by electrical field stimulation (20 V, 1-32 Hz) in the presence or absence 
      of PnTx2-6 (10(-8) M). Cavernosal strips from nNOS- and endothelial nitric oxide 
      synthase (eNOS)-knockout (KO) mice, besides nNOS inhibitor (10(-5) M), were used to 
      evaluate the role of this enzyme in the potentiation effect evoked by PnTx2-6. 
      Tissue cGMP levels were determined after stimulation with PnTx2-6 in presence or 
      absence of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (10(-4) M) and ω-conotoxin GVIA 
      (10(-6) M), an N-type calcium channel inhibitor. Results showed that PnTx2-6 
      enhanced cavernosal relaxation in diabetic mice (65%) and eNOS KO mice, but not in 
      nNOS KO mice. The toxin effect in the cavernosal relaxation was abolished by nNOS 
      inhibitor. cGMP levels are increased by PnTx2-6, however, L-NAME abolished this 
      enhancement as well as ω-conotoxin GVIA. We conclude that PnTx2-6 facilitates penile 
      relaxation in diabetic mice through a mechanism dependent on nNOS, probably via 
      increasing nitric oxide/cGMP production.

TI  - Effects of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom on mouse peripheral nerve.
PG  - 623-40
AB  - A physiological and morphological study has been made of the effects of the venom of 
      the spider Phoneutria nigriventer on peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle of the 
      mouse. Venom was injected either into the sciatic nerve, via a glass micropipette, 
      or into the calf muscles. Repetitive firing of nerve fibres commenced within seconds 
      of injection and caused fasciculation of muscles and irregular trains of end-plate 
      potentials. These physiological disturbances were associated with swelling of the 
      nodal and paranodal axoplasm and the development of vacuoles in the periaxonal 
      space. The segments of internode between the vacuoles became attenuated, with an 
      increase in the density of axoplasmic organelles and a reduction in axonal calibre. 
      The repetitive firing ceased after 1-3 h with development of conduction block. Both 
      the physiological and the morphological abnormalities gradually resolved and by 24 h 
      nerve conduction and morphology had largely returned to normal. It seems likely that 
      these short-lived abnormalities are a consequence of the influx of sodium ions at 
      the nodes of Ranvier, caused by the action of the venom on sodium channels.

TI  - Acetylcholine release from rat brain cortical slices evoked by the fraction P4 of 
      the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer has Ca2+ and temperature independent 
      components.
PG  - 159-62
AB  - Fractionation of the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer revealed that it was 
      a mixture of several neurotoxic peptides. The peptides so far characterized either 
      inhibited or induced neurotransmitter release. These effects were mediated by Ca2+ 
      channels or increasing Na+ permeability through voltage sensitive Na(+)-channels, 
      respectively. The pooled toxic components (fraction P4) showed stimulatory effects 
      on acetylcholine release from brain cortical slices. In addition, a component of the 
      observed effects resembling that of alpha-latrotoxin was identified, which was 
      characterized by the ability to provoke release of acetylcholine (ACh) at low 
      temperature and in a manner independent of extracellular Ca2+ and of voltage 
      sensitive Na(+)-channels.

TI  - Tx2-6 toxin of the Phoneutria nigriventer spider potentiates rat erectile function.
PG  - 1197-206
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.02.010 [doi]
AB  - The venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer contains several toxins that have 
      bioactivity in mammals and insects. Accidents involving humans are characterized by 
      various symptoms including penile erection. Here we investigated the action of 
      Tx2-6, a toxin purified from the P. nigriventer spider venom that causes priapism in 
      rats and mice. Erectile function was evaluated through changes in intracavernosal 
      pressure/mean arterial pressure ratio (ICP/MAP) during electrical stimulation of the 
      major pelvic ganglion (MPG) of normotensive and deoxycorticosterone-acetate 
      (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Nitric oxide (NO) release was detected in cavernosum 
      slices with fluorescent dye (DAF-FM) and confocal microscopy. The effect of Tx2-6 
      was also characterized after intracavernosal injection of a non-selective nitric 
      oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME. Subcutaneous or intravenous injection of 
      Tx2-6 potentiated the elevation of ICP/MAP induced by ganglionic stimulation. L-NAME 
      inhibited penile erection and treatment with Tx2-6 was unable to reverse this 
      inhibition. Tx2-6 treatment induced a significant increase of NO release in 
      cavernosum tissue. Attenuated erectile function of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was 
      fully restored after toxin injection. Tx2-6 enhanced erectile function in 
      normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, via the NO pathway. Our studies 
      suggest that Tx2-6 could be important for development of new pharmacological agents 
      for treatment of erectile dysfunction.

TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of a polypeptide from Phoneutria nigriventer 
      spider venom that relaxes rabbit corpus cavernosum in vitro.
PG  - 1141-7
AB  - The venom of the Brazilian spider Phoneutria nigriventer was fractionated using a 
      C18 microBondapack reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column. The 
      resulting fractions were assayed in the rabbit perfused corpus cavernosum tissue to 
      identify those fractions responsible for the corpus cavernosum relaxation. Two 
      fractions (A and B) with retention times of 18.1 and 36.7 min, respectively, induced 
      relaxation of corpus cavernosum strips. Fraction A was selected for further 
      biochemical characterization. Repurification of this fraction revealed the presence 
      of a polypeptide (named PNV4) which migrates in sodium dodecyl 
      sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band consistent with a mol. 
      wt close to 16,600. The amino acid composition of PNV4 showed the presence of 147 
      residues, a high content of Cys and a calculated mol. wt of 17,213 + Trp. The 
      N-terminal amino acid sequence of PNV4 determined for its first 48 residues was

      synaptosomes.
PG  - 1371-3
AB  - Neurotoxins can help the understanding of mechanisms involved in neurotransmission. 
      We here report that two neurotoxin isoforms, Tx3-3 and Tx3-4 obtained from the venom 
      of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer inhibited the 45Ca2+ influx in rat cortical 
      synaptosomes induced by the scorpion venom tityustoxin. The IC50 for Tx3-3 and Tx3-4 
      were 0.32 and 7.9 nM, respectively. The neurotoxins Tx3-3 and Tx3-4 are very 
      effective in inhibiting 45Ca2+ influx and they should be useful in studies involving 
      Ca(2+)-dependent processes.

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer toxin Tx1 (PnTx1, also referred to in the literature as Tx1) 
      exerts inhibitory effect on neuronal (Na(V)1.2) sodium channels in a way dependent 
      on the holding potential, and competes with μ-conotoxins but not with tetrodotoxin 
      for their binding sites. In the present study we investigated the 
      electrophysiological properties of the recombinant toxin (rPnTx1), which has the 
      complete amino acid sequence of the natural toxin with 3 additional residues: AM on 
      the N-terminal and G on the C-terminal. At the concentration of 1.5 μM, the 
      recombinant toxin inhibits Na(+) currents of dorsal root ganglia neurons (38.4 ± 
      6.1% inhibition at -80 mV holding potential) and tetrodotoxin-resistant Na(+) 
      currents (26.2 ± 4.9% at the same holding potential). At -50 mV holding potential 
      the inhibition of the total current reached 71.3 ± 2.3% with 1.5 μM rPnTx1. The 
      selectivity of rPnTx1 was investigated on ten different isoforms of voltage-gated 
      sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The order of potency for rPnTx1 was: 
      rNa(V)1.2 > rNa(V)1.7 ≈ rNa(V)1.4 ≥ rNa(V)1.3 > mNa(V)1.6 ≥ hNa(V)1.8. No effect was 
      seen on hNa(V)1.5 and on the arthropods isoforms (DmNa(V)1, BGNa(V)1.1a and 
      VdNa(V)1). The IC(50) for Na(V)1.2 was 33.7 ± 2.9 nM with a maximum inhibition of 
      83.3 ± 1.9%. The toxin did not alter the voltage-dependence of channel gating and 
      was effective on Na(V)1.2 channels devoid of inactivation. It was ineffective on 
      neuronal calcium channels. We conclude that rPnTx1 has a promising selectivity, and 
      that it may be a valuable model to achieve pharmacological activities of interest 
      for the treatment of channelopathies and neuropathic pain.

TI  - Evaluation of DNA damage in spinal cord and mutagenic effect of a Phα1β recombinant 
      toxin with analgesic properties from the Phoneutria nigriventer spider.
PG  - 615-620
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13171 [doi]
AB  - Phα1β peptide isolated from the venom of the Phoneutria nigriventer spider has shown 
      higher analgesic action in pre-clinical studies than ω-conotoxin MVIIA peptide used 
      to treat severe chronic pain. In view of the great potential for the development of 
      a new Phα1β-based drug, a Phα1β recombinant form (CTK 01512-2) has been studied for 
      efficacy and safety. The aim of this study was to evaluate cytotoxic, genotoxic and 
      mutagenic effects of a Phα1β recombinant form and compare it with native Phα1β and 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT 
      (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) colourimetric assay 
      in L929 mouse fibroblast cells (0.5-10.0 μmol/L). Genotoxic and mutagenic activities 
      were analysed using the alkaline comet assay in peripheral blood and spinal cord, 
      and the micronucleus test in bone marrow from Wistar rats treated by intrathecal 
      injection of CTK 01512-2 (200, 500 and 1000 pmol/site), native Phα1β (500 pmol/site) 
      and ω-conotoxin MVIIA (200 pmol/site). CTK 01512-2 decreased the cell viability of 
      the L929, showing IC(50) of 3.3 ± 0.1 µmol/L, while the Phα1β and ω-conotoxin MVIIA 
      did not show cytotoxicity (IC(50)  > 5.0 µmol/L). Native and recombinant Phα1β forms 
      induced DNA damage in the spinal cord, but not in peripheral blood. CTK 01512-2 at 
      1000 pmol/site increased the micronucleus frequency suggesting mutagenic effects. In 
      conclusion, the recombinant form has cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects, 
      evidenced in doses five times above the therapeutic dose.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer omega-Phonetoxin IIA: a new tool for anti-calcium channel 
      autoantibody assays in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
PG  - 57-63
AB  - Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neurological autoimmune disease in 
      which downregulation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) leads to reduced 
      acetylcholine release from motoneuron terminals. 70% of cases are paraneoplastic and 
      rapid diagnosis of LEMS can result in early detection of the underlying tumor. 
      Serological assays based on the capacity of autoantibodies to precipitate VGCCs 
      labeled with radioligands provide valuable data. We have established a novel assay 
      using the spider venom peptide 125I-omega-Phonetoxin IIA (125I-omegaPtxIIA). 
      125I-omegaPtxIIA labeled recombinant Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels and endogenous VGCCs 
      in rat brain membranes. Autoantibodies that immunoprecipitate a 
      125I-omegaPtxIIA/channel complex were detected in 26/31 (84%) LEMS patients. The 
      patients that were seropositive in the 125I-omegaPtxIIA assay corresponded precisely 
      to the population that was positive for Cav2.1 and/or Cav2.2 antibodies detected 
      using two different omega-conotoxins. Thus, the 125I-omegaPtxIIA assay detects a 
      broader spectrum of autoantibody specificities than current omega-conotoxin-based 
      assays.

TI  - Effects of Phoneutria nigriventer venom on rabbit vascular smooth muscle.
PG  - 81-91
AB  - 1. The effects of Phneutria nigriventer venom (PNV) on rabbit vascular smooth muscle 
      have been investigated. De-endothelialized vascular strips were superfused in a 
      cascade system with oxygenated (95% O2 + 5% CO2) Krebs solution at 37 degrees C. 2. 
      Phoneutria nigriventer venom (0.3-30 micrograms) produced dose-dependent and 
      short-lived contractions of both venous (cava, mesenteric and jugular veins) and 
      arterial (pulmonary and mesenteric arteries) tissues. 3. Methysergide (5.0 microM) 
      did not significantly affect PNV-induced contractions in venous tissues (cava and 
      mesenteric veins) or pulmonary artery, indicating that serotonin is not involved in 
      the contraction. This was confirmed when PNV was dialyzed (24-48 h) since the 
      contracting activity was still observed on the above tissues. In addition, the 
      spasmogenic activity induced by dialyzed PNV was greatly reduced by incubating the 
      venom with trypsin. 4. Neither tetrodotoxin (3.0 microM) nor phenoxybenzamine (0.05 
      microM) significantly affected PNV-induced contractions, suggesting that 
      voltage-dependent sodium channel activation or endogenous catecholamine release from 
      autonomic nerve endings on the vascular walls do not play a role in the response to 
      PNV. 5. Our results demonstrate that PNV contains non-dialyzable components, 
      probably peptides, that are responsible for the contractile activity on rabbit veins 
      and pulmonary artery strips.

AB  - Molecules from animal venoms are promising candidates for the development of new 
      drugs. Previous in vitro studies have shown that the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer (PnV) is a potential source of antineoplastic components with activity 
      in glioblastoma (GB) cell lines. In the present work, the effects of PnV on tumor 
      development were established in vivo using a xenogeneic model. Human GB (NG97, the 
      most responsive line in the previous study) cells were inoculated (s.c.) on the back 
      of RAG(-/-) mice. PnV (100 µg/Kg) was administrated every 48 h (i.p.) for 14 days 
      and several endpoints were evaluated: tumor growth and metabolism (by microPET/CT, 
      using (18)F-FDG), tumor weight and volume, histopathology, blood analysis, 
      percentage and profile of macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells isolated from the 
      spleen (by flow cytometry) and the presence of macrophages (Iba-1 positive) 
      within/surrounding the tumor. The effect of venom was also evaluated on macrophages 
      in vitro. Tumors from PnV-treated animals were smaller and did not uptake detectable 
      amounts of (18)F-FDG, compared to control (untreated). PnV-tumor was necrotic, 
      lacking the histopathological characteristics typical of GB. Since in classic 
      chemotherapies it is observed a decrease in immune response, methotrexate (MTX) was 
      used only to compare the PnV effects on innate immune cells with a highly 
      immunosuppressive antineoplastic drug. The venom increased monocytes, neutrophils 
      and NK cells, and this effect was the opposite of that observed in the animals 
      treated with MTX. PnV increased the number of macrophages in the tumor, while did 
      not increase in the spleen, suggesting that PnV-activated macrophages were led 
      preferentially to the tumor. Macrophages were activated in vitro by the venom, 
      becoming more phagocytic; these results confirm that this cell is a target of PnV 
      components. Spleen and in vitro PnV-activated macrophages were different of M1, 
      since they did not produce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Studies in progress 
      are selecting the venom molecules with antitumor and immunomodulatory effects and 
      trying to better understand their mechanisms. The identification, optimization and 
      synthesis of antineoplastic drugs from PnV molecules may lead to a new multitarget 
      chemotherapy. Glioblastoma is associated with high morbidity and mortality; 
      therefore, research to develop new treatments has great social relevance. Natural 
      products and their derivatives represent over one-third of all new molecular 
      entities approved by FDA. However, arthropod venoms are underexploited, although 
      they are a rich source of new molecules. A recent in vitro screening of the 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PnV) antitumor effects by our group has shown 
      that the venom significantly affected glioblastoma cell lines. Therefore, it would 
      be relevant to establish the effects of PnV on tumor development in vivo, 
      considering the complex neoplastic microenvironment. The venom was effective at 
      impairing tumor development in murine xenogeneic model, activating the innate immune 
      response and increasing tumor infiltrating macrophages. In addition, PnV activated 
      macrophages in vitro for a different profile of M1. These activated PnV-macrophages 
      have potential to fight the tumor without promoting tumorigenesis. Studies in 
      progress are selecting the venom molecules with antitumor and immunomodulatory 
      effects and trying to better understand their mechanisms. We aim to synthesize and 
      carry out a formulation with these antineoplastic molecules for clinical trials. 
      Spider venom biomolecules induced smaller and necrotic xenogeneic GB; spider venom 
      activated the innate immune system; venom increased blood monocytes and the 
      migration of macrophages to the tumor; activated PnV-macrophages have a profile 
      different of M1 and have a potential to fight the tumor without promote 
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - Toxin 2 (PhTx2), a neurotoxic fraction from Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom, 
      causes acute morphological changes in mouse skeletal muscle.
PG  - 793-812
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer (Labidognatha, Ctenidae) is a spider found in the warm 
      regions of South America. Bites by this species cause intense local pain, autonomic 
      dysfunction and paralysis. PhTx2, a neurotoxic fraction of the venom of this 
      species, interferes with the physiology of sodium channel function. The present 
      study describes the morphological changes in mouse phrenic nerve and diaphragm 
      muscle after 15, 30, 45 and 60 min of incubation with 1 microg of PhTx2/ml. Light 
      and transmission electron microscopy showed that PhTx2 caused progressive 
      myonecrosis which involved swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial 
      damage, disorganization of the sarcomeres, zones of hypercontracted myofibrils and 
      rupture of the plasma membrane. The intramuscular fascicles of the phrenic nerve 
      showed vacuolated myelinated axons and Schwann cells. The neuromuscular junctions 
      had vesicle-depleted nerve terminals with swollen mitochondria. The axolema was 
      frequently invaginated and sequestered portions of the axoplasm, or was sometimes 
      interrupted at the site of the synaptic gutter. The post-synaptic junctional folds 
      were shallow and disperse. These morphological alterations in the muscle and nerve 
      fibres were similar to those caused by osmotic disturbances and agree with the 
      ability of PhTx2 to increase the permeability of sodium channels. An increase in 
      sodium influx would probably be accompanied by an influx of water and an elevation 
      in the concentration of cytosolic calcium as a result of calcium release by the 
      sarcoplasmic reticulum and/or mitochondria and the entry of extracellular calcium. 
      The morphological effects caused by PhTx2 were comparable to those seen with 
      Phoneutria nigriventer whole venom which is known to activate and to delay the 
      inactivation of sodium channels. We conclude that PhTx2 is probably the main toxic 
      fraction responsible for such morphological alterations.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer toxin Tx3-1 blocks A-type K+ currents controlling Ca2+ 
      oscillation frequency in GH3 cells.
PG  - 1472-81
AB  - GH3 cells present spontaneous Ca2+ action potentials and oscillations of 
      intracellular Ca2+, which can be modified by altering the activity of K+ or Ca2+ 
      channels. We took advantage of this spontaneous activity to screen for effects of a 
      purified toxin (Tx3-1) from the venom of Phoneutria nigriventer on ion channels. We 
      report that Tx3-1 increases the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations, as do two blockers 
      of potassium channels, 4-aminopyridine and charybdotoxin. Whole-cell patch clamp 
      experiments show that Tx3-1 reversibly inhibits the A-type K+ current (I(A)) but 
      does not block other K+ currents (delayed-rectifying, inward-rectifying, and 
      large-conductance Ca2+-sensitive) or Ca2+ channels (T and L type) in these cells. In 
      addition, we describe the sequence of a full cDNA clone of Tx3-1, which shows that 
      Tx3-1 has no homology to other known blockers of K+ channels and gives insights into 
      the processing of this neurotoxin. We conclude that Tx3-1 is a selective inhibitor 
      of I(A), which can be used to probe the role of this channel in the control of 
      cellular function. Based on the effect of Tx3-1, we suggest that I(A) is an 
      important determinant of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in unstimulated GH3 
      cells.

TI  - Effect of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom on gastric emptying in rats.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - The effect of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) on the gastric emptying of 
      liquids was studied in 240 young adult Wistar rats (2-3 months of age) divided into 
      subgroups of 8 animals each. The study was performed in 3 stages. Initially, PNV was 
      injected into rats at doses of 0.19, 0.38 or 0.76 mg/kg and the effect on gastric 
      emptying was assessed 30 min later. In the second stage, a time-course study was 
      performed by injecting 0.76 mg PNV/kg and measuring the effect on gastric emptying 
      15, 60 and 120 min post-venom. In the last stage, in order to investigate the 
      possible mechanisms of PNV influence on gastric emptying, one group of rats 
      underwent subdiaphragmatic vagotomy and then received 0.76 mg PNV/kg while three 
      other groups were pretreated iv with either prazosin (0.4 mg/kg), domperidone (1.0 
      mg/kg) or propranolol (0.6 mg/kg) and then given 0.38 or 0.76 mg PNV/kg. In this 
      last stage, gastric retention was measured 30 min post-venom. Each animal received a 
      saline test meal solution containing phenol red as a marker (60 micrograms/ml). Ten 
      min after administering the test meal by gavage, gastric retention was determined by 
      measuring the residual test meal marker concentration and the animals were 
      sacrified. PNV (0.76 mg/kg) provoked a significant delay in gastric emptying of 
      liquids 15, 30 and 60 min after its administration. Propranolol partially interfered 
      with gastric emptying in rats that had received 0.38 and 0.76 mg PNV/kg. Vagotomy 
      and pretreatment of the rats with prazosin and domperidone had no effect. We 
      conclude that the delay in the liquid gastric emptying observed in severely 
      envenomed rats was probably due, at least in part, to a venom-stimulated release of 
      catecholamines which inhibited gastric motility by activating smooth muscle 
      beta-adrenergic receptors.

TI  - Nitric oxide-induced vasorelaxation in response to PnTx2-6 toxin from Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider in rat cavernosal tissue.
PG  - 3879-88
LID - 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01978.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Priapism is one of several symptoms observed in accidental bites by 
      the spider Phoneutria nigriventer. The venom of this spider is comprised of many 
      toxins, and the majority has been shown to affect excitable ion channels, mainly 
      sodium (Na(+) ) channels. It has been demonstrated that PnTx2-6, a peptide extracted 
      from the venom of P. nigriventer, causes erection in anesthetized rats and mice. 
      AIM: We investigated the mechanism by which PnTx2-6 evokes relaxation in rat corpus 
      cavernosum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PnTx2-6 toxin potentiates nitric oxide 
      (NO)-dependent cavernosal relaxation. METHODS: Rat cavernosal strips were incubated 
      with bretylium (3 × 10(-5) M) and contracted with phenylephrine (PE; 10(-5) M). 
      Relaxation responses were evoked by electrical field stimulation (EFS) or sodium 
      nitroprusside (SNP) before and after 4 minutes of incubation with PnTx2-6 (10(-8) 
      M). The effect of PnTx2-6 on relaxation induced by EFS was also tested in the 
      presence of atropine (10(-6) M), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, N-type Ca(2+) 
      channel blockers (ω-conotoxin GVIA, 10(-6) M) and sildenafil (3 × 10(-8) M). 
      Technetium99m radiolabeled PnTx2-6 subcutaneous injection was administrated in the 
      penis. RESULTS: Whereas relaxation induced by SNP was not affected by PnTx2-6, 
      EFS-induced relaxation was significantly potentiated by this toxin as well as 
      PnTx2-6 plus SNP. This potentiating effect was further increased by sildenafil, not 
      altered by atropine, however was completely blocked by the N-type Ca(2+) channels. 
      High concentrated levels of radiolabeled PnTx2-6 was specifically found in the 
      cavernosum tissue, suggesting PnTx2-6 is an important toxin responsible for P. 
      nigriventer spider accident-induced priapism. CONCLUSION: We show that PnTx2-6 slows 
      Na(+) channels inactivation in nitrergic neurons, allowing Ca(2+) influx to 
      facilitate NO/cGMP signalling, which promotes increased NO production. In addition, 
      this relaxation effect is independent of phosphodiesterase enzyme type 5 inhibition. 
      Our data displays PnTx2-6 as possible pharmacological tool to study alternative 
      treatments for erectile dysfunction.

TI  - Acute blood-brain barrier permeabilization in rats after systemic Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom.
PG  - 18-29
AB  - A highly controlled transport of substances at the interface between blood and brain 
      characterizes the blood-brain barrier (BBB), fundamental for maintenance of the 
      homeostasis of the cerebral milieu. In this study, we investigated the time course 
      (15 min, 1, 2, and 5 h) of BBB opening induced by intravenous (i.v.) injection of 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) using quantitative and morphological 
      approaches on cerebellum and hippocampus vessels for assessment of BBB permeability. 
      The results showed vasogenic edema and tracer extravasation faster and severalfold 
      higher in hippocampus than in cerebellum. Reactive astrocytes with swollen 
      perivascular end-feet processes were found only in cerebellum. An immediate and 
      total degradation of laminin in capillaries occurred resulting in the disappearance 
      of the basement membrane. In medium-sized vessels, this effect was less prominent. 
      The changes were transient, with cerebellum in general presenting a faster recovery. 
      However, at 5 h laminin was overexpressed, principally in hippocampus. The rapid and 
      abrupt shift of laminin expression in capillaries (at 15 min) coincided with the 
      immediate and severe signs of intoxication shown by the animals, but not with the 
      peak of leakage of vessels and vasogenic edema, which occurred later (1-2 h). The 
      findings suggest a complex regulatory mechanism, since the extension of BBB 
      impairment caused by PNV depends on the region of the SNC, and on the vessels types. 
      It is suggested that the components of the BBB (gliovascular unit) have a critical 
      role in these differences. P. nigriventer venom can be a useful tool to explore the 
      mechanisms of BBB.

TI  - Expression of a functional recombinant Phoneutria nigriventer toxin active on K+ 
      channels.
PG  - 305-13
AB  - PnTx3-1 is a peptide isolated from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer 
      that specifically inhibits A-type K(+) currents (I(A)) in GH(3) cells. Here we used 
      a bacterial expression system to produce an NH(2)-extended mutant of PnTx3-1 
      (ISEF-PnTx3-1) and tested whether the toxin is functional. The recombinant toxin was 
      purified from bacterial extracts by a combination of affinity and ion-exchange 
      chromatography. The recombinant toxin blocked A-type K(+) currents in GH(3) cells in 
      a fashion similar to that observed with the wild-type toxin purified from the spider 
      venom. These results suggest that recombinant cDNA methods provide a novel source 
      for the production of functional Phoneutria toxins. The recombinant ISEF-PnTx3-1 
      should be useful for further understanding of the role of A-type K(+) currents in 
      biological processes.

TI  - Identification of a new vascular smooth muscle contracting polypeptide in Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 1092-5
AB  - The fractionation of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom by gel filtration (Sephadex 
      G-10-120) followed by ion-exchange chromatography (microgranular CM-cellulose-52) 
      resulted in sixteen fractions (CI to CXVI) from which CVII+VIII, CIX and CX+XI 
      caused dose-dependent and short-lived contractions of both arterial and venous 
      rabbit vessels. Fraction CX+XI was further purified by a reverse phase HPLC, and a 
      contractile polypeptide (PNV2) was isolated. The amino terminal sequence of PNV2 
      (LAKRADICQPGKTSQRACET) indicated that it represents a pure polypeptide consisting of 
      a single chain. Furthermore, the amino acid analysis of PNV2 revealed the presence 
      of four disulfide bridges, a high content in Lys (14%), Glx (11%), and the absence 
      of His. The global amino acid composition showed that this polypeptide is composed 
      of 102 residues (Trp not included) with a calculated molecular weight of 12,114. 
      Whether this peptide is responsible for the vascular alterations observed in 
      Phoneutria envenomation, such as lung edema and priapism, remains to be further 
      investigated.

AB  - We report the characterization of a new class of glutamate uptake inhibitors 
      isolated from Phoneutria nigriventer venom. Glutamate transport activity was assayed 
      in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes by using [(3)H]-L-glutamate. PhTx4 inhibited 
      glutamate uptake in a dose dependent manner. The IC(50) value obtained was 
      2.35+/-0.9 microg/ml which is in the observed range reported for glutamate uptake 
      blockers. Tx4-7, one of PhTx4 toxins, showed the strongest inhibitory activity 
      (50.3+/-0.69%, n=3).

      desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometric analyses to solve 
      micro-heterogeneity in post-translationally modified peptides from Phoneutria 
      nigriventer (Aranea, Ctenidae) venom.
PG  - 31-7
AB  - Previous studies of the fractionated venom of the Brazilian armed spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, obtained by gel filtration, have demonstrated the presence of a 
      fraction PhM, a pool of small peptides (up to 2000 Da) that provoke contractions in 
      smooth muscle of guinea pig ileum. Initial attempts to sequence these peptides were 
      largely unsuccessful because of the low purification yield and the fact that the 
      majority seemed to be blocked at their N-termini. In the present work, analysis of 
      this venom fraction by mass spectrometry has revealed the existence of a highly 
      complex mixture of peptides with molecular weights corresponding to those observed 
      for the muscle-active peptides previously described (800-1800 Da). These peptides 
      appear to be a family of isoforms with some particular features. The amino acid 
      sequences of 15 isoforms have been determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) 
      using both electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
      (ESI-Q/ToFMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight 
      mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/ToFMS). These molecules contain post-translational 
      modifications such as proteolysis and C-terminal amidation, which combine to 
      generate additional isoforms. All the isoforms sequenced in this study possess an 
      N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue. A search for sequence similarities with other 
      peptides in databanks revealed that these peptides are structurally related to the 
      tachykinins, a family of neuro-hormone peptides. The data obtained in this study 
      will be essential for the subsequent steps of this research, the synthesis of these 
      peptides and pharmacological characterization of their biological activity.

      1993. Crude Phoneutria nigriventer venom was fractionated by Sephadex, ion-exchange 
      and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. One protein (PNV1) with 
      spasmogenic activity in rabbit vascular smooth muscle was isolated and biochemically 
      characterized. PNV1 has 125 amino acid residues and a calculated mol. wt of 13,899. 
      Special features of the amino acid composition of PNV1 are the presence of two 
      disulfide bridges and the high percentage (27%) of Asx and Glx. The N-terminal amino 
      acid sequence indicates that PNV1 is different from other polypeptides isolated from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer venom.

TI  - Mode of action of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom at the isolated phrenic 
      nerve-diaphragm of the rat.
PG  - 557-65
AB  - The effects of Phoneutria nigriventer venom on muscle contraction and bioelectrical 
      potentials were investigated in the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm muscle preparation. 
      The venom caused a non-uniform depolarization of the diaphragm muscle fiber 
      membrane. This effect was abolished by tetrodotoxin or reduction of the sodium 
      concentration in the bath fluid. The increase in the frequency of miniature 
      end-plate potentials induced by the venom was also suppressed by tetrodotoxin. These 
      results indicate that the venom activates the voltage-dependent sodium channel in 
      muscle and nerve cell membranes. All the effects of the venom on the phrenic 
      nerve-diaphragm muscle preparation (i.e. increase in twitch tension, delay in twitch 
      relaxation, initial tonic contraction of short duration, spontaneous small phasic 
      contractions, blockade of neuromuscular transmission, repetitive firing in nerve and 
      muscle fiber membranes) can be explained on the basis of its action in the sodium 
      channel. Nearly all of these effects are caused by discharges of repetitive action 
      potentials in the nerve and/or muscle fiber membranes.

TI  - Upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor, Flt-1, in rat hippocampal 
      neurons after envenoming by Phoneutria nigriventer; age-related modulation.
PG  - 656-64
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.05.015 [doi]
AB  - This study characterizes the distribution and quantifies the expression of the 
      tyrosine kinase receptor for the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flt-1, 
      in the rat hippocampus following intra-peritoneal injection of Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom (PNV). Post-natal day 14 (P14) and 8-10 weeks (adult) old rats 
      were used and analyses were done at 1, 2, 5 and 24 h after venom exposure and 
      compared with saline-injected counterparts. PNV-injected animals showed hippocampal 
      venules with perivascular edema indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. 
      This was accompanied by significant overexpression of Flt-1 which though was not the 
      same for CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal regions, neither for P14 
      and adult rats. Regional analysis using GIMP methodology showed that Flt-1 was 
      constitutively distributed more densely in neurons of DG, followed by CA1/CA2 and 
      CA3 of both control P14 and adult animals, without variation over time, but 
      significantly more expressed in P14 than in adults. A time-course analysis showed 
      that Flt-1 upregulation was progressive and that neurons VEGFR1/Flt-1+ of 
      PNV-exposed animals are timely and regionally modulated depending on the hippocampal 
      region, being CA2 the least responsive region regardless animal's age, whilst DG was 
      the most susceptible with adult animals having higher upregulation than neonates. 
      Since VEGF has been reported to confer protection in several pathological processes 
      we suggest that VEGF may be involved in hippocampal neurons response via Flt-1 
      mediation following PNV envenoming; its higher upregulation in adult envenomed rats 
      may be an indication that Flt-1 neuroprotective mediation is more efficient with 
      age. The Flt-1 upregulation and the incidence of perivascular edema in young animals 
      may indicate a pro-inflammatory role of the receptor.

TI  - Erection induced by Tx2-6 toxin of Phoneutria nigriventer spider: expression profile 
      of genes in the nitric oxide pathway of penile tissue of mice.
PG  - 793-801
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.06.006 [doi]
AB  - The peptides Tx2-5 and Tx2-6, isolated from the whole venom of 
      "armed-spider"Phoneutria nigriventer venom, are directly linked with the induction 
      of persistent and painful erection in the penis of mammals. The erection induced by 
      Tx2-6 has been associated with the activation of nitric oxide synthases. There is a 
      scarcity of studies focusing on the outcome of Tx2-6 at the molecular level, by this 
      reason we evaluated the gene profile activity of this toxin at the nitric oxide (NO) 
      pathway. After microarray analyses on cavernous tissue of mice inoculated with Tx2-6 
      we found that only 10.4% (10/96) of these genes were differentially expressed, 
      showing a limited effect of the toxin on the NO pathway. We found the genes sparc, 
      ednrb, junb, cdkn1a, bcl2, ccl5, abcc1 over-expressed and the genes sod1, s100a10 
      and fth1 under-expressed after inoculation of Tx2-6. The differential expressions of 
      sparc and ednrb genes were further confirmed using real-time PCR. Interestingly, 
      ednrb activates the L-arginine/NO/cGMP pathway that is involved in the relaxation of 
      the cavernous body. Therefore the priapism induced by Tx2-6 is a consequence of a 
      highly specific interference of this neurotoxin with the NO pathway.

TI  - Endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat mesenteric arterial rings by a Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom fraction.
PG  - 189-96
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom has been described as acting on several 
      cardiovascular sites. In the present paper, a semi-purified fraction of this spider 
      venom was studied to observe any contractile or relaxing effect in rat mesenteric 
      arterial rings (MAR). Spider venom was first fractionated by gel filtration and 
      subsequently by gradual isocratic steps in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The first 
      fraction of this last fractionation step is studied in the present paper and due to 
      its main effect, it was named NORF (nitric oxide releasing fraction). No direct 
      contractile effect was induced by NORF in relaxed MAR, suggesting no NORF-induced 
      neurotransmitter release in this preparation. No significant influence of NORF was 
      observed on concentration-response curves to phenylephrine on endothelium-denuded 
      MAR, but a significant inhibitory shift of concentration-respense curves was 
      observed on endothelium-preserved MAR (EC50 = 0.39 +/- 0.07 microM for control and 
      EC50 = 0.68 +/- 0.14 microM with NORF). NORF induced concentration-dependent 
      relaxation in endothelium-preserved phenylephrine pre-contracted MAR but not in 
      endothelium-denuded MAR. NORF-induced relaxation was inhibited by the nitric oxide 
      synthase inhibitor L-NAME (N(omega)-nitro-arginine methyl ester). Indomethacin or 
      HOE-140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-bradykinin) had no significant effect on 
      NORF-induced relaxation. Acetylcholine- and NORF-induced relaxation of 
      pre-contracted MAR were differently inhibited by atropine. The pA2 value for 
      atropine-acetylcholine was 9.78 +/- 0.06 and that for atropine-NORF was 8.53 +/- 
      0.30 (P<0.01). These observations suggest that NORF induces concentration-dependent 
      liberation of nitric oxide from MAR endothelium and that a non-muscarinic mechanism 
      might be involved in this effect. Our data suggest no involvement of prostanoids or 
      bradykinin in the relaxing mechanism.

TI  - Pathological changes induced by PhTx1 from Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom in 
      mouse skeletal muscle in vitro.
PG  - 1349-61
AB  - The 'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer is responsible for most human accidents 
      involving spiders in Brazil. The effects of fraction Tx1 (PhTx1) from the venom of 
      this spider were investigated by physiological and morphological methods using the 
      mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation. PhTx1 (1 and 5 microg) did not affect the 
      twitch tension of muscle fibers under indirect electrical stimulation. At this same 
      concentration, PhTx1 also did not alter the miniature end-plate potential (mepp) 
      frequency and amplitude, nor did it change the resting membrane potential 60 min 
      after addition to the preparation. Light microscopy (LM) revealed that in muscles 
      incubated with PhTx1 a number of fibers were morphologically altered, as evidenced 
      by microvacuolization and myofibril hypercontraction and loss within 15 min after 
      toxin administration. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed sarcoplasmic 
      reticulum swelling, disorganization of the sarcomeres and mitochondrial damage, and 
      occasionally, sarcolemmal discontinuities with a persisting basal membrane. The 
      intra-muscular fascicles of the phrenic nerve showed myelinated axons with 
      vacuolated myelin sheaths as well as peri- and intra-axoplasmic vacuoles. The 
      neuromuscular junction changes were variable, but were rarely severe. Thus, although 
      PhTx1 did not depolarize or hyperpolarize the neuromuscular junction, it was 
      nevertheless toxic to a restricted number of muscle fibers and nerve structures. The 
      site of action of PhTx1 may involve the sarcolemma and axolemma as suggested by the 
      morphological abnormalities which could reflect hydroelectrolytic disturbances.

TI  - Isolation of a pure toxic polypeptide from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer and its neurophysiological activity on an insect femur preparation.
PG  - 1059-67
AB  - The venom of the South American spider Phoneutria nigriventer has been separated 
      into eleven fractions by gel filtration. The neurophysiological activity of each 
      fraction was tested by perfusion of a locust femur preparation. Fractions which gave 
      a neurophysiological response on this perfusion were fractionated further by 
      ion-exchange chromatography. The purity of each sub-fraction was monitored by 
      isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels and isoelectric points determined. From 
      one of the polypeptide-containing fractions, a pure, almost neutral polypeptide was 
      isolated and shown to have a molecular weight between 5500 and 5900. The amino acid 
      composition of the pure polypeptide was: Ala6,7 Arg2,3 Asx3 Cys8 Glx3 Gly4 Ile4 Leu1 
      Lys5,6 Phe2 Ser5 Thr3 Trp1 Tyr2 Val2. This polypeptide elicited the greatest 
      neurophysiological activity of all fractions tested. When the polypeptide (2 X 
      10(-7) M) was perfused through the locust femur preparation, action potentials were 
      generated along the length of the axons in the crural nerve, resulting in very rapid 
      and uncontrolled twitching of the skeletal muscles. At higher concentrations, the 
      crural nerve discharged repetitively, both spontaneously and in response to a single 
      electrical stimulus. The other polypeptide fractions, although less pure, had 
      neurophysiological responses similar to those observed with the pure polypeptide; 
      the effects of some fractions could be reversed. Further fractions of low molecular 
      weight were purified by thin-layer or paper chromatography to give two pure 
      components that are probably nucleosides or nucleotides. After the initial gel 
      filtration of the total venom had separated the high molecular weight proteinases 
      from the polypeptides, all of the polypeptides retained their neurophysiological 
      activity in solution for several days. In the presence of the proteinases, the 
      polypeptides were inactivated in solution in a few hours at room temperature.

TI  - An evaluation of the antinociceptive effects of Phα1β, a neurotoxin from the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, and ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a cone snail Conus magus toxin, in 
      rat model of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.
PG  - 59-67
LID - 10.1007/s10571-012-9871-x [doi]
AB  - Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) underlie cell excitability and are 
      involved in the mechanisms that generate and maintain neuropathic and inflammatory 
      pain. We evaluated in rats the effects of two VSCC blockers, ω-conotoxin MVIIA and 
      Phα1β, in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain induced with complete Freund's 
      adjuvant (CFA) and chronic constrictive injury (CCI), respectively. We also 
      evaluated the effects of the toxins on capsaicin-induced Ca(2+) influx in dorsal 
      root ganglion (DRG) neurons obtained from rats exposed to both models of pain. A 
      single intrathecal injection of Phα1β reversibly inhibits CFA and CCI-induced 
      mechanical hyperalgesia longer than a single injection of ω-conotoxin MVIIA. Phα1β 
      and MVIIA also inhibited capsaicin-induced Ca(2+) influx in DRG neurons. The 
      inhibitory effect of Phα1β on capsaicin-induced calcium transients in DRG neurons 
      was greater in the CFA model of pain, while the inhibitory effect of ω-conotoxin 
      MVIIA was greater in the CCI model. The management of chronic inflammatory and 
      neuropathic pain is still a major challenge for clinicians. Phα1β, a reversible 
      inhibitor of VSCCs with a preference for N-type Ca(2+) channels, has potential as a 
      novel therapeutic agent for inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Clinical studies are 
      necessary to establish the role of Phα1β in the treatment of chronic pain.

TI  - Pharmacological characterization of rabbit corpus cavernosum relaxation mediated by 
      the tissue kallikrein-kinin system.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - 1. The roles of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system and nitric oxide (NO) release in 
      Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced relaxations of rabbit corpus cavernosum (RbCC) 
      smooth muscle have been investigated by use of a bioassay cascade. 2. Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom (10-30 micrograms), porcine pancreatic kallikrein (100 mu), rabbit 
      urinary kallikrein (10 mu), bradykinin (BK, 0.3-3 nmol), acetylcholine (ACh, 0.3-30 
      nmol) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 0.5-10 nmol) caused relaxations of the RbCC 
      strips. Captopril (1 microM) substantially potentiated Phoneutria nigriventer venom- 
      and BK-induced RbCC relaxations without affecting those elicited by GTN. 3. The 
      bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D- Tic7,Oic8]-BK, 50 
      nM), aprotinin (10 micrograms ml-1) and the tissue kallikrein inhibitor, 
      Pro-Phe-Aph-Ser-Val- Gln-NH2 (KIZD-06, 1.3 microM) significantly inhibited 
      Phoneutria nigriventer venom-induced RbCC relaxations, without affecting those 
      provoked by GTN and ACh. The B1 receptor antagonist, [Leu9]des Arg10BK (0.5 microM) 
      and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 10 micrograms ml-1) had no effect on Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom-induced RbCC relaxations. 4. The relaxations induced by Phoneutria 
      nigriventer venom, porcine pancreas kallikrein, BK and ACh were significantly 
      inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 microM) but not by 
      D-NAME (10 microM). L-NAME did not affect GTN-induced relaxations. L-Arginine (300 
      microM), but not D-arginine (300 microM), significantly reversed the inhibitory 
      effect of L-NAME. 5. Our results indicate that Phoneutria nigriventer venom 
      activates the tissue kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in RbCC strips leading to NO 
      release and suggest a functional role for this system in penile erection.

TI  - From the stretcher to the pharmacy's shelf: drug leads from medically important 
      brazilian venomous arachnid species.
PG  - 411-9
AB  - Accidents involving venomous animals have always caught the attention of mankind due 
      to their lethality and other clinical implications. However, since the molecules 
      obtained from animal venoms have been the product of millions of years of 
      evolutionary process, toxins could be used to probe physiological mechanisms and 
      could serve as leads for drug development. The present work reviews the state of the 
      art pertaining to venom molecules from Brazilian medically important arachnid 
      species bearing potential biotechnological applications. Special focus is given to 
      toxins isolated from the scorpion Tityus serrulatus and the spiders Phoneutria 
      nigriventer and Lycosa erythrognatha, whose venoms possess molecules acting as 
      erectile function modulators and as antihypertensive, analgesic, neuroprotective and 
      antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Effects of new Phoneutria spider toxins on glutamate release and [Ca2+]i in rat 
      cortical synaptosomes.
PG  - OL1223-30
AB  - Studies revealed that the venom of the Brazilian "armed" spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer contains potent neurotoxins that caused excitatory symptoms such as 
      salivation, lachrymation, priapism, convulsions, flaccid and spastic paralysis. It 
      was also reported that the main mechanism of action of those neurotoxins are effects 
      on ion channels such as inhibition of the inactivation of Na+ channels, blockage of 
      K+ channels and blockage of calcium channels. The venom from Phoneutria keyserlingi, 
      as might be expected, contains a series of polypeptides that are very similar, but 
      not identical, to the proteins previously obtained from the venom of P. nigriventer 
      in terms of their amino acid sequences and biological activities. We evaluated the 
      effects of some of the toxins of P. nigriventer and P. keyserlingi on glutamate 
      release and the decrease in [Ca2+]i by using synaptosomes of rat brain cortices and 
      fluorimetric assays. Sequence comparisons between the Phoneutria toxins of both the 
      species showed great similarity in the location of cysteine residues. However, thus 
      far, no pharmacological assays were performed to evaluate the extension of those 
      biochemical modifications. Our results showed that differences between the amino 
      acid sequences of Phoneutria toxins of both the species lead to the significant 
      changes in the pharmacological properties of these toxins.

AB  - The use of natural substances for the treatment of diseases or injuries is an 
      ancient practice of many cultures. According to folklore, natural aphrodisiacs may 
      help to raise libido and increase desire. The supposed aphrodisiacs mainly include a 
      plethora of preparations of plants, among other substances. However, the real 
      boundary between myth and reality has not been established yet in most cases and 
      such boundaries must be drawn by scientific methods. A growing interest of the 
      scientific community has been focused on animal venoms, especially those from 
      arthropods, i.e. spiders and scorpions, which cause priapism, a prolonged and 
      painful erection. This review highlights the studies that have been performed with 
      venoms and toxins from arthropods known to cause priapism, among other toxic 
      symptoms, pointing out some pharmacological approaches for better understanding this 
      effect. To date, the venom of some spiders, mainly Phoneutria nigriventer, and 
      scorpions, such as the yellow South American scorpion Tityus serrulatus, among 
      others, have been known to cause priapism. Since erectile dysfunction (ED) is a 
      growing health problem in the world, more common in patients with vascular diseases 
      as diabetes and hypertension, the use of animal venoms and toxins as pharmacological 
      tools could not only shed light to the mechanisms involved in erectile function, but 
      also represent a possible model for new drugs to treat ED. Unfortunately, attempts 
      to correlate the structure of those priapism-related toxins were unfruitful. Such 
      difficulties lie firstly on the poor data concerning purified priapism-related 
      toxins, instead of whole venoms and/or semi-purified fractions, and secondly, on the 
      scarce available primary sequences and structural data, mainly from spider toxins. 
      It has been shown that all these toxins modify the sodium (Na(+)) channel activity, 
      mostly slowing down its inactivation current. Improving the knowledge on the 
      tertiary structure of these toxins could provide a key in the search of a new drug 
      for ED treatment.

TI  - Investigation of the effect of PhTx2, from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, on the release of [3H]-acetylcholine from rat cerebrocortical 
      synaptosomes.
PG  - 1189-92
AB  - Venoms from spiders are an important source of toxins that can help on the 
      dissection of mechanisms involved in neurotransmission. Among them is the venom of 
      the spider Phoneutria nigriventer that contains several toxic fractions with 
      different targets in mammals and/or insects. We here report that one of these 
      fractions (PhTx2) is able to evoke acetylcholine release from rat cortical 
      synaptosomes and that this effect is dependent on extracellular calcium and is 
      inhibited by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin.

TI  - Differential effects of the recombinant toxin PnTx4(5-5) from the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer on mammalian and insect sodium channels.

AB  - The toxin PnTx4(5-5) from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer is extremely 
      toxic/lethal to insects but has no macroscopic behavioral effects observed in mice 
      after intracerebral injection. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that it inhibits 
      the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) - subtype of glutamate receptors of cultured rat 
      hippocampal neurons. PnTx4(5-5) has 63% identity to PnTx4(6-1), another insecticidal 
      toxin from P. nigriventer, which can slow down the sodium current inactivation in 
      insect central nervous system, but has no effect on Nav1.2 and Nav1.4 rat sodium 
      channels. Here, we have cloned and heterologous expressed the toxin PnTx4(5-5) in 
      Escherichia coli. The recombinant toxin rPnTx4(5-5) was tested on the sodium channel 
      NavBg from the cockroach Blatella germanica and on mammalian sodium channels 
      Nav1.2-1.6, all expressed in Xenopus leavis oocytes. We showed that the toxin has 
      different affinity and mode of action on insect and mammalian sodium channels. The 
      most remarkable effect was on NavBg, where rPnTx4(5-5) strongly slowed down channel 
      inactivation (EC50 = 212.5 nM), and at 1 μM caused an increase on current peak 
      amplitude of 105.2 ± 3.1%. Interestingly, the toxin also inhibited sodium current on 
      all the mammalian channels tested, with the higher current inhibition on Nav1.3 
      (38.43 ± 8.04%, IC50 = 1.5 μM). Analysis of activation curves on Nav1.3 and Nav1.5 
      showed that the toxin shifts channel activation to more depolarized potentials, 
      which can explain the sodium current inhibition. Furthermore, the toxin also 
      slightly slowed down sodium inactivation on Nav1.3 and Nav1.6 channels. As far as we 
      know, this is the first araneomorph toxin described which can shift the sodium 
      channel activation to more depolarized potentials and also slows down channel 
      inactivation.

TI  - Characterization of the antinociceptive effect of PhTx3-4, a toxin from Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, in models of thermal, chemical and incisional pain in mice.

AB  - Venom-derived peptides constitute a unique source of drug prototypes for the pain 
      management. Many of them can modulate voltage-gated calcium channels that are 
      central in the processing of pain sensation. PhTx3-4 is a peptide isolated from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer venom, which blocks high voltage-activated calcium channels 
      with low specificity, thereby leading to neuroprotection in models of ischemia in 
      vitro. The aim of the present work was evaluating the potential of intrathecal 
      PhTx3-4 in the reversal of different nociceptive states in mice, furthermore 
      assessing the potential of PhTx3-4 in triggering motor side effects. We found that 
      bellow 100 pmol/site, PhTx3-4 did not cause major motor side effects. By comparison, 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA and ω-conotoxin MVIIC triggered motor side effects at the doses of 
      10 and 100 pmol/site, respectively. Also, PhTx3-4 (30 pmol/site) caused no 
      significant alterations in the forced locomotor activity test (rotarod) and in the 
      exploratory activity test (versamax). In a model of inflammatory persistent pain 
      (formalin test), PhTx3-4 reversed nociceptive behavior both pre or 
      post-administered, although this effect was observed only at the inflammatory phase 
      of the test and not at the neurogenic phase. Comparatively, ω-conotoxin MVIIC was 
      effective only when post-administered in the formalin test. Nonetheless, PhTx3-4 
      treatment was devoid of action in acute nociceptive thermal model (hotplate test), 
      whereas morphine showed efficacy in this test. Efficacy of PhTx3-4 in the formalin 
      test was associated with inhibition of formalin-induced glutamate release in the 
      cerebrospinal fluid. PhTx3-4, but not ω-conotoxin MVIIC, reversed NMDA-induced 
      nociceptive behavior indicating a putative role of PhTx3-4 at ionotropic glutamate 
      receptors. Finally, we observed efficacy of PhTx3-4 in ameliorating mechanical 
      hypersensitivity induced by paw incision, a post-operative and more clinically 
      relevant pain model. Taken together, our data show that PhTx3-4 possesses 
      antinociceptive effect in different models of pain in mice, suggesting that this 
      toxin may serve as drug prototype for pain control.

AB  - The proteomes of the venoms of the Brazilian wandering "armed" spiders Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, Phoneutria reidyi, and Phoneutria keyserlingi, were compared using 
      two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The venom components were also fractionated 
      using a combination of preparative reverse phase HPLC on Vydac C4, analytical 
      RP-HPLC on Vydac C8 and C18 and cation exchange FPLC on Resource S at pH 6.1 and 
      4.7, or anion exchange HPLC on Synchropak AX-300 at pH 8.6. The amino acid sequences 
      of the native and S-pyridyl-ethylated proteins and peptides derived from them by 
      enzymatic digestion and chemical cleavages were determined using a Shimadzu 
      PPSQ-21(A) automated protein sequencer, and by MS/MS collision induced 
      dissociations. To date nearly 400 peptides and proteins (1.2-27 kDa) have been 
      isolated in a pure state and, of these, more than 100 have had their complete or 
      partial amino acid sequences determined. These sequences demonstrate, as might be 
      expected, that the venoms of P. reidyi and P. keyserlingi (Family: Ctenidae) both 
      contain a similar range of isoforms of the neurotoxins as those previously isolated 
      from P. nigriventer which are active on neuronal ion (Ca(2+), Na(+) and K(+)) 
      channels and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. In addition two new families of small 
      (3-4 kDa) toxins, some larger protein (>10 kDa) components, and two serine 
      proteinases of the venom of P. nigriventer are described. These enzymes may be 
      responsible for some of the post-translational modification observed in some of the 
      venom components.

TI  - Phoneutria nigriventer (armed spider) venom induces increased vascular permeability 
      in rat and rabbit skin in vivo.
PG  - 1011-6
AB  - The effect of intradermally injected Phoneutria nigriventer venom (PNV) on vascular 
      permeability of both rat and rabbit skin has been investigated. Oedema formation was 
      measured as the local extravascular accumulation at skin sites of intravenously 
      injected 125I-human serum albumin. In both rat and rabbit PNV induced dose-dependent 
      oedema which was greatly potentiated by the vasodilators calcitonin-gene-related 
      peptide and prostaglandin E1. In rats, PNV-induced oedema was markedly reduced 
      either by previous treatment of the animals with the histamine H1 antagonist 
      mepyramine and the serotonin antagonist methysergide or when venom was dialysed, 
      indicating a major role for histamine and serotonin. In rabbits, dialysis of the 
      venom to remove histamine and serotonin did not reduce PNV-induced oedema, 
      indicating presence of oedematogenic component(s) which are different from the 
      amines histamine or serotonin.

TI  - Animal venom peptides cause antinociceptive effects by voltage-gated calcium 
      channels activity blockage.
LID - 10.2174/1570159X19666210713121217 [doi]
AB  - Pain is a complex phenomenon that is usually unpleasant and aversive. It can range 
      widely in intensity, quality, and duration and has diverse pathophysiologic 
      mechanisms and meanings. Voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels are essential to 
      transmitting painful stimuli from the periphery until the dorsal horn of the spinal 
      cord. Thus, blocking voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) can effectively control 
      pain refractory to treatments currently used in the clinic, such as cancer and 
      neuropathic pain. VGCCs blockers isolated of cobra Naja naja kaouthia 
      (α-cobratoxin), spider Agelenopsis aperta (ω-Agatoxin IVA), spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer (PhTx3.3, PhTx3.4, PhTx3.5, PhTx3.6), spider Hysterocrates gigas 
      (SNX-482), cone snails Conus geographus (GVIA), Conus magnus (MVIIA or ziconotide), 
      Conus catus (CVID, CVIE and CVIF), Conus striatus (SO-3), Conus fulmen (FVIA), Conus 
      moncuri (MoVIA and MoVIB), Conus regularis (RsXXIVA), Conus eburneus (Eu1.6), Conus 
      victoriae (Vc1.1.), Conus regius (RgIA), and spider Ornithoctonus huwena 
      (huwentoxin-I and huwentoxin-XVI) venoms caused antinociceptive effects in different 
      acute and chronic pain models. Currently, ziconotide is the only clinical used 
      N-type VGCCs blocker peptide for chronic intractable pain. However, ziconotide 
      causes different adverse effects. The intrathecal route of administration also 
      impairs its use in a more significant number of patients. In this sense, peptides 
      isolated from animal venoms or their synthetic forms that modulate or block VGCCs 
      channels seem to be a relevant prototype for developing new analgesics efficacious 
      and well tolerated by patients.

TI  - Leftward shift in the voltage-dependence for Ca2+ currents activation induced by a 
      new toxin from Phoneutria reidyi (Aranae, Ctenidae) venom.
PG  - 129-46
AB  - Various neurotoxins have been described from the venom of the Brazilian spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, but little is known about the venoms of the other species of 
      this genus. In the present work, we describe the purification and some structural 
      and pharmacological features of a new toxin (PRTx3-7) from Phoneutria reidyi that 
      causes flaccid paralysis in mice. The observed molecular mass (4627.26 Da) was in 
      accordance with the calculated mass for the amidated form of the amino acid sequence 
      (4627.08 Da). The presence of an alpha-amidated C-terminus was confirmed by MS/MS 
      analysis of the C-terminal peptide, isolated after enzymatic digestion of the native 
      protein with Glu-C endoproteinase. The purified protein was injected 
      (intracerebro-ventricular) into mice at dose levels of 5 microg/mouse causing 
      immediate agitation and clockwise gyration, followed by the gradual development of 
      general flaccid paralysis. PRTx3-7 at 1 microM inhibited by 20% the KCl-induced 
      increase on [Ca2+]i in rat brain synaptosomes. The HEK cells permanently expressing 
      L, N, P/Q and R HVA Ca2+ channels were also used to better characterize the 
      pharmacological features of PRTx3-7. To our surprise, PRTx3-7 shifted the 
      voltage-dependence for activation towards hyperpolarized membrane potentials for L 
      (-4 mV), P/Q (-8 mV) and R (-5 mV) type Ca2+ currents. In addition, the new toxin 
      also affected the steady state of inactivation of L-, N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ currents.

TI  - Components from spider venom activate macrophages against glioblastoma cells: new 
      potential adjuvants for anticancer immunotherapy.
PG  - 51-68
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvab020 [doi]
AB  - Immunomodulation has been considered an important approach in the treatment of 
      malignant tumours. However, the modulation of innate immune cells remains an 
      underexplored tool. Studies from our group demonstrated that the Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom (PnV) administration increased the infiltration of 
      macrophage in glioblastoma, in addition to decreasing the tumour size in a 
      preclinical model. The hypothesis that PnV would be modulating the innate immune 
      system led us to the main objective of the present study: to elucidate the effects 
      of PnV and its purified fractions on cultured macrophages. Results showed that PnV 
      and the three fractions activated macrophages differentiated from bone marrow 
      precursors. Further purification generated 23 subfractions named low weight (LW-1 to 
      LW-12) and high weight (HW-1 to HW-11). LW-9 presented the best immunomodulatory 
      effect. Treated cells were more phagocytic, migrated more, showed an activated 
      morphological profile and induced an increased cytotoxic effect of macrophages on 
      tumour cells. However, while M1-controls (LPS) increased IL-10, TNF-alpha and IL-6 
      release, PnV, fractions and subfractions did not alter any cytokine, with the 
      exception of LW-9 that stimulated IL-10 production. These findings suggest that 
      molecules present in LW-9 have the potential to be used as immunoadjuvants in the 
      treatment of cancer.

PG  - 636-46
LID - 10.1016/j.neuro.2009.04.004 [doi]
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) causes uneven BBB permeability throughout 
      different cerebral regions. Little is known about cellular and molecular responses 
      which course with the PNV-induced BBB opening. We investigate by 
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB), the GFAP, S100, IFN-gamma and 
      TNF-alpha proteins expression in hippocampus and cerebellum after different 
      time-points from venom or saline intravenous injection. All proteins variably 
      altered its expression temporally and regionally. WB showed increased GFAP content 
      at 15-45 min followed by a shift below the control level which was less pronounced 
      in hippocampus. IHC showed reactive gliosis during all the trial period. In 
      cerebellum, GFAP was mostly immunodetected in astrocytes of the molecular layer 
      (Bergmann glia), as was S100 protein. The maximum S100 immunolabeling was achieved 
      at 5h. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, expressed mostly by hippocampal neurons, increased 
      along the trial period, suggesting a role in BBB permeability. In envenomed animals, 
      closer contacts astrocyte-astrocyte, granule cells-granule cells and 
      astrocytes-Purkinje cells were observed in cerebellum. Closer contacts between 
      neurons-neurons-astrocytes-astrocytes were also seen in hippocampus. PNV contains 
      serotonin, histamine, Ca(2+) channels-blocking toxins, some of which affect 
      glutamate release. The hypothesis that such substances plus the cytokines generated, 
      could have a role in BBB permeability, and that calcium homeostasis loss and 
      disturbance of glutamate release are associated with the marked GFAP/S100 reaction 
      in Bergmann glia is discussed. The existence of a CNS mechanism of defense modulated 
      differentially for fast synthesis and turnover of GFAP, S100, IFN-gamma and 
      TNF-alpha proteins was evident. A clear explanation for this differential modulation 
      is unclear, but likely result from regional differences in astrocytic/neuronal 
      populations, BBB tightness, and/or extent/distribution of microvasculature and/or 
      ion channels density/distribution. Such differences would respond for transient 
      characteristics of BBB disruption. This in vivo model is useful for studies on drug 
      delivery throughout the CNS and experimental manipulation of the BBB.

TI  - Neuroprotective effect on brain injury by neurotoxins from the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer.
PG  - 543-7
AB  - The role of calcium channels blockers in ischemic condition has been well 
      documented. The PhTx3 neurotoxic fraction of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer venom 
      is a broad-spectrum calcium channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release, calcium 
      uptake and also glutamate uptake in synaptosomes. In the present study we describe 
      the effect of PhTx3 (1.0 microg/mL), omega-conotoxin GVIA (1.0 micromol/L) and 
      omega-conotoxin MVIIC (100 nmol/L) on neuroprotection of hippocampal slices and SN56 
      cells subjected to ischemia by oxygen deprivation and low glucose insult (ODLG). 
      After the insult, cell viability in the slices and SN56 cells was assessed by 
      confocal microscopy and epifluorescence, using live/dead kit containing calcein-AM 
      and ethidium homodimer. Confocal images of CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slices 
      subjected to ischemia insult and treated with omega-conotoxin GVIA, omega-conotoxin 
      MVIIC and PhTx3 showed a percentage of dead cells of 68%, 54% and 18%, respectively. 
      The SN56 cells subjected to ischemia were almost completely protected from damage by 
      PhTx3 while with omega-conotoxin GVIA or omega-conotoxin MVIIC the cell protection 
      was only partial. Thus, PhTx3 provided robust ischemic neuroprotection showing 
      potential as a novel class of agents that targets multiple components and exerts 
      neuroprotection in in vitro model of brain ischemia.

TI  - The effect of PnTx2-6 protein from Phoneutria nigriventer spider toxin on 
      improvement of erectile dysfunction in a rat model of cavernous nerve injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic potential of PnTx2-6 injected 3 times a week 
      for 4 weeks into the intracavernosal tissue in a rat model of bilateral cavernous 
      nerve crush injury (BCNI). METHODS: Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      randomly divided into the following 6 groups (n = 5 per group): age-matched control 
      (normal group), BCNI (injury group), post-BCNI phosphate-buffered saline injection 
      (PBS group), post-BCNI Sf9 cell-lysate injection (N/C group), post-BCNI injection of 
      cell lysate from S9 cells infected with wild-type recombinant baculovirus (W/T 
      group), and post-BCNI injection of cell lysate from S9 cells infected with 
      recombinant baculovirus containing PnTx2-6 (PnTx2-6 group). Injections were 
      delivered 3 times a week for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, intracavernosal 
      pressure-to-mean arterial pressure ratio, smooth muscle and collagen content via the 
      Masson trichrome staining, levels of neural nitric oxide synthase, 
      phosphoendothelial nitric oxide synthase, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate were 
      all measured. RESULTS: The PnTx2-6 group showed significantly higher intracavernosal 
      pressure-to-mean arterial pressure ratio (P <.05), smooth muscle-to-collagen ratio 
      (P <.01), expression levels of neural nitric oxide synthase, phosphoendothelial 
      nitric oxide synthase (P <.05), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (P <.05) than all 
      other experimental groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that PnTx2-6 improved erectile 
      function and prevented muscle atrophy in a rat model of BCNI via increased synthesis 
      of nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate.

TI  - Investigation of the haemodynamic effects of Phoneutria nigriventer venom in 
      anaesthetised rabbits.
PG  - 841-53
AB  - The haemodynamic alterations induced by the central and peripheral administration of 
      the armed spider (Phoneutria nigriventer) venom (PNV) were investigated in 
      anaesthetised rabbits. The intracerebroventricular injection of increasing doses of 
      PNV (30 and 100 microg/kg) elicited a biphasic cardiovascular response characterised 
      by a brief hypotension (1-3 min) followed by a marked and sustained (more than 30 
      min) increase in mean arterial pressure (61 +/- 5 and 61 +/- 10%, respectively) and 
      in systemic vascular resistance (135 +/- 21 and 161 +/- 37%) accompanied by mild 
      increases in cardiac contractility. Systemic alterations such as salivation and 
      muscular fasciculation were also observed. At the opposite, the dose of 100 
      microg/kg of PNV injected intravenously produced only a hypotensive effect (29 +/- 
      4% decrease in mean arterial pressure) and a decrease in vascular resistance (38 +/- 
      5%). Nevertheless, a much higher dose of PNV (1 mg/kg) injected intravenously 
      produced a hypertensive response analogous to the one observed upon central 
      administration. The central hypertensive response induced by PNV was not affected by 
      preteating the animals with selective antagonists of receptors of different 
      neurotransmitters or endogenous mediators such as: acethylcoline muscarinic, 
      bradykinin B2, angiotensin II AT1 receptors and also antagonists of the excitatory 
      amino acid receptors of the central nervous system. Nevertheless, the intravenous 
      pretreatment with the selective alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin 
      significantly blunted the excitatory cardiovascular response evoked by the central 
      injection of PNV. It is concluded that PNV can induce central as well as peripheral 
      haemodynamic effects. The central component seems to be mediated by the activation 
      of cardiovascular centres which in turn lead to an increase in the sympathetic 
      outflow to the periphery, whereas the peripheral component can be accounted for 
      either by direct activation of the vascular alpha1-adrenergic receptors or by 
      catecholamine release from the sympathetic nerve endings.

TI  - Sequence of the cDNA coding for the lethal neurotoxin Tx1 from the Brazilian "armed" 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer predicts the synthesis and processing of a 
      preprotoxin.
PG  - 15340-2
AB  - A cDNA library was constructed from the venom glands of the Brazilian "armed" 
      spider, Phoneutria nigriventer, and a clone coding for Tx1, a lethal toxin, was 
      identified and sequenced. The sequence data derived from this cDNA clone combined 
      with the previously determined amino acid sequence predict that Tx1 is initially 
      synthesized as a preprotoxin. Four segments (comprising the signal sequence, a 
      short, 15-amino acid, glutamate-rich sequence, the functional toxin, and 2 glycine 
      residues) can be distinguished. The structure of the preprotoxin and the proposed 
      processing steps required to form the mature Tx1 toxin show similarities with the 
      synthesis and processing of omega-agatoxin IA.

TI  - Penile erection induced in vivo by a purified toxin from the Brazilian spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 835-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07762.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To verify the effect on erectile tissue of mice of two neuropeptides 
      extracted from the poison of a spider, Phoneutria nigriventer, (Tx2-5 and -6, termed 
      'eretina') after direct injection into the corpus cavernosum, to assess the minimum 
      dosage necessary for effect, the time for initiation of action, the local duration 
      of the erection, histological effects and the presence of local and systemic 
      side-effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: When applied intraperitoneally, eretina 
      promotes the relaxation of cavernous smooth muscle, thus causing penile erection. 
      Thirty-five mice were divided in two groups; 10 control mice were injected 20 microL 
      of saline solution, and in the treated group, 25 mice were divided into groups of 
      five and each subgroup received eretina in decreasing doses (0.024, 0.012, 0.006, 
      0.003 and 0.0015 microg/kg) until the minimum dose that produced an erection was 
      determined. After treatment all mice were monitored to determine the response and 
      any collateral effects. RESULTS: The minimum dose producing an erection was 0.006 
      microg/kg, the five mice in this group having evidence of an erection at 35-45 min 
      after injection. The histology of the cavernosum of mice treated with eretina showed 
      dilatation and congestion of the vascular spaces with more blood than in controls. 
      With the minimum dose there were no local or systemic collateral effects and the 
      erection was lost after 120-140 min. CONCLUSION: The minimum dose of eretina 
      producing an erection in mice was determined, and the agent was safe for this use as 
      it did not produce any collateral toxic effects. These studies indicate a possible 
      means of determining the mechanism of action of eretina.

TI  - ω-Phonetoxin-IIA: a calcium channel blocker from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 545-52
AB  - A peptide with neurotoxic effect on mammals, purified from the venom of the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, was studied regarding its primary structure and its effects 
      on voltage-gated calcium channels. The peptide, named ω-phonetoxin-IIA, has 76 amino 
      acids residues, with 14 Cys forming 7 disulphide bonds, and a molecular weight of 
      8362.7 Da. The neurotoxicity is a consequence of the peptide’s blocking effects on 
      high-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channels. N-type HVA calcium channels of rat 
      dorsal root ganglion neurons are blocked with affinity in the sub-nanomolar 
      concentration range. The toxin also blocks L-type channels of rat β pancreatic 
      cells, with an affinity 40 times lower. Although not studied in detail, evidence 
      indicates that the toxin also blocks other types of HVA calcium channels, such as P 
      and Q. No effect was observed on low-voltage-activated, T-type calcium channels. The 
      significant homologies between ω-phonetoxin-IIA and the peptides of the 
      ω-agatoxin-III family, and the overlapping inhibitory effects on calcium channels 
      are discussed in terms of the structure-activity relationship.

TI  - Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding insecticidal neurotoxic peptides from the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 1443-9
AB  - From a Phoneutria nigriventer venom gland cDNA library several clones coding for the 
      insect specific neurotoxin Tx4(6-1) were isolated. cDNA analysis showed that the 
      encoded protein contained three distinct segments, comprising a signal sequence of 
      16 amino acids, followed by a glutamate-rich sequence of 18 amino acids and, 
      finally, the coding region for the mature toxin. The deduced amino acid sequence for 
      the mature polypeptide was identical to the protein sequence determined chemically. 
      In addition, two new putative toxins called Pn4A and Pn4B were characterized and 
      their predicted complete amino acid sequence revealed approximately 78% similarity 
      to Tx4(6-1).

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of Phoneutria nigriventer toxins active on 
      calcium channels.
PG  - 755-63
AB  - The aim of the present study was the molecular cloning of toxins active on calcium 
      channels expressed by the spider Phoneutria nigriventer. Clones encoding the toxins 
      Pn3-3A, Pn3-4A, Tx3-5, Pn3-5A, Tx3-6, Pn3-6A and Pn3-6B were identified from a cDNA 
      library derived from the venom gland of this spider, revealing toxins of 49, 76, 45, 
      39, 55 and 58 amino acids residues, respectively, with polypeptide precursors being 
      composed of three major portions: a signal peptide, a propeptide and finally, the 
      mature toxin. A high degree of homology with the amino acid sequence was found 
      between Pn3-3A and the neurotoxin Tx3-3 (identity of 79%), and between Pn3-4A and 
      the neurotoxin Tx3-4 (identity of 95%). The deduced amino acid sequence for the 
      mature polypeptides Tx3-5 and Tx3-6 confirms the polypeptide sequence previously 
      published for these neurotoxins. In addition, the toxin Pn3-5A showed 58% identity 
      to the Tx3-5 amino acid sequence, and the toxins Pn3-6A and Pn3-6B showed 85 and 33% 
      identity, respectively, to the Tx3-6 amino acid sequence.

TI  - Inhibition of neuronal high-voltage activated calcium channels by the 
      omega-phoneutria nigriventer Tx3-3 peptide toxin.
PG  - 1756-67
AB  - We have investigated the effect of omega-PnTx3-3 (referred to in previous papers 
      simply as Tx3-3), a peptide toxin from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, on neuronal high-voltage activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels, using 
      whole-cell patch-clamp. omega-PnTx3-3 (120 nM) blocked 74+/-8% of the total HVA 
      Ca(2+) currents of cerebellar granule neurones, without affecting the low-voltage 
      activated (LVA) current. P/Q/R-type currents in cerebellar granule neurones, 
      isolated using 4 microM nicardipine and 100 nM omega-conotoxin GVIA, were markedly 
      (79+/-6%) inhibited by 60 nM omega-PnTx3-3. R-type currents, isolated either by 
      additional application of 0.5-1 microM of omega-agatoxin IVA or by pre-incubation 
      with 5 microM omega-conotoxin MVIIC were inhibited almost totally by 120 nM of 
      omega-PnTx3-3. omega-PnTx3-3 reversibly altered the kinetics of the P/Q/R current, 
      increasing the degree of inactivation that occurred during a 50 ms pulse from 20% to 
      40%. N-type currents, recorded from neuroblastoma N18 cells, were partially 
      (34+/-2%) inhibited by 320 nM omega-PnTx3-3. L-type currents, recorded from GH3 
      cells, were partially (45+/-12%) inhibited by 80 nM omega-PnTx3-3. We conclude that 
      omega-PnTx3-3 inhibits all known HVA Ca(2+) channels, and most effectively the P/Q- 
      and R-type currents.

TI  - Blockade of neuronal nitric oxide synthase abolishes the toxic effects of Tx2-5, a 
      lethal Phoneutria nigriventer spider toxin.
PG  - 169-72
AB  - The primary goal of this study was to determine whether Tx2-5, a sodium channel 
      selective toxin obtained from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, 
      produced penile erection by means of nitric oxide mechanism. Toxin identity was 
      analyzed by MALDI-TOF, ES-MS and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Pretreating mice 
      with the non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor 
      N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) and the selective 
      neuronal-NOS inhibitor 7-Nitroindazole (7-NI) prior to Tx2-5 i.p. (10 microg/25 g 
      mouse) injection challenged the hypothesis above. Controls were injected with the 
      D-isomer or DMSO or saline. Results demonstrated that L-NAME inhibited penile 
      erections in about half the animals treated, while 7-NI completely abolished this 
      effect. Interestingly 7-NI also abolished all the other symptoms of intoxication 
      induced by Tx2-5, including salivation, respiratory distress and death. Tx2-5 killed 
      all the animals of the control group and no one in the 7-NI-treated group. We 
      conclude that (1) intraperitoneal injections of Tx2-5 induce a toxic syndrome that 
      include penile erection, hypersalivation and death by respiratory distress or 
      pulmonary edema; (2) pretreatment with the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME 
      reduces the penile erection and partially protects from the lethal effects of Tx2-5; 
      (3) pretreatment with the nNOS-selective inhibitor 7-NI completely abolishes all the 
      toxic effects of Tx2-5, including penile erection and death suggesting that nNOS is 
      the major player in this intoxication; (4) toxins from other animals that affect 
      sodium channels in the same way as Tx2-5 and induce similar toxic syndromes may have 
      as a major common target, the activation of nitric oxide synthases.

TI  - Activation of tissue kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in rabbit skin by a fraction 
      isolated from Phoneutria nigriventer (armed spider) venom.
PG  - 1385-91
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer venom was fractionated by gel filtration followed by 
      ion-exchange chromatography from which 16 fractions (I-XVI) were obtained and 
      assayed in rabbit skin in order to identify those responsible for the increased 
      vascular permeability observed with the whole venom. The fractions, and control 
      mediators (tissue kallikrein, bradykinin and histamine) were intradermally injected 
      in male New Zealand white rabbits. Local oedema formation was measured as the local 
      accumulation of i.v. injected 125I-human serum albumin into skin sites. Fraction 
      XIII was the only fraction assayed which significantly induced oedema formation. 
      Fraction XIII-induced oedema was greatly reduced by either the protease inhibitor 
      aprotinin or the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist D-Arg,[Hyp3,Thi5,8D-Phe7]-Bk, 
      whereas the plasma kallikrein inhibitor soybean trypsin inhibitor failed to 
      significantly affect this oedematogenic response. The kininase II inhibitor 
      captopril markedly potentiated fraction XIII-induced oedema. Our results indicate 
      that the increased vascular permeability induced by fraction XIII is due to local 
      generation of kinins in response to tissue (but not plasma) kallikrein-kinin system 
      activation.

TI  - Role of kinins and sensory neurons in the rat pleural leukocyte migration induced by 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 158-62
AB  - The leukocyte migration induced by Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) has 
      been investigated in rats using the pleurisy model. Intrapleural injection of PNV 
      (10-100 microg/cavity) caused a dose- and time-dependent leukocyte accumulation. The 
      bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.5 mg/kg) substantially inhibited 
      PNV-induced cell accumulation, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
      captopril (2 mg/kg) potentiated by 80% this effect. The non-specific kallikrein 
      inhibitor aprotinin and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor soybean trypsin inhibitor 
      greatly reduced PNV-induced leukocyte migration, whereas the selective tissue 
      kallikrein inhibitor P(ac)-F-S-R-EDDnp failed to affect PNV-induced responses. 
      Treatment of rats with capsaicin (50 mg/kg) at the neonatal stage resulted in 67% 
      inhibition of the PNV-induced cell migration. The neurokinin NK(1) receptor 
      antagonist SR140333, but not the NK(2) receptor antagonist SR48968, reduced by 55% 
      venom-induced cell accumulation. We conclude that bradykinin generation is involved 
      in the PNV-induced pleural leukocyte migration in rats, where it can directly 
      activate sensory nerves contributing to a neurogenic inflammatory mechanism.

TI  - The toxin Tx4(6-1) from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer slows down Na(+) current 
      inactivation in insect CNS via binding to receptor site 3.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - Tx4(6-1) a neurotoxic peptide from the venom of the aggressive South American 
      'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer, has been previously isolated and sequenced. 
      It shows no detectable activity in mice but affects the peripheral nervous system of 
      insects by stimulating glutamate release at the neuromuscular junction. Here we 
      investigate possible interactions of the toxin with voltage-activated sodium 
      channels (Na(v)). We confirm that it is ineffective on mammalian Na(v) channels, and 
      establish that it competes with the alpha-like toxin 125I-Bom IV, for binding on the 
      site 3 of insect Na(v) channel (IC(50) value around 25nM). The physiological 
      consequences of this binding to the insect Na(v) channel are shown by 
      electrophysiology: Tx4(6-1) prolongs evoked axonal action potentials (APs) 
      (<500&mgr;s duration in control). Prolonged 8-10ms or 'plateau' 500-800ms APs 
      accompanied by repetitive firing at 80-150Hz are recorded after 4-8min of toxin 
      action. This modification of evoked activity is due to a slowing down of sodium 
      current inactivation. Effects of Tx4(6-1) on sodium current are compared with those 
      of a typical scorpion alpha-toxin and of some other spider toxins active on insect 
      Na(v) channels. At the end of long voltage pulses, the maintained inward sodium 
      current may represent 50% of the peak current after scorpion alpha-toxin but only 
      about 8-10% after spider toxins. To understand the slight differences in the effects 
      of alpha-scorpion and spider toxins on the insect Na(v) channel, structural studies 
      of toxin-channels interactions would be necessary.

TI  - A toxin from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer that blocks calcium channels coupled 
      to exocytosis.
PG  - 591-7
AB  - 1. The aim of the present experiments was to investigate the pharmacological action 
      of a toxin from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, Tx3-3, on the function of calcium 
      channels that control exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. 2. Tx3-3, in confirmation of 
      previous work, diminished the intracellular calcium increase induced by membrane 
      depolarization with KCl (25 mM) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. The toxin was 
      very potent (IC50 0.9 nM) at inhibiting calcium channels that regulate calcium entry 
      in synaptosomes. In addition, Tx3-3 blocked the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, as 
      measured with the fluorescent dye FM1-43. 3. Using omega-toxins that interact 
      selectively with distinct neuronal calcium channels, we investigated whether the 
      target of Tx3-3 overlaps with known channels that mediate exocytosis. The results 
      indicate that the main population of voltage-sensitive calcium channels altered by 
      Tx3-3 can also be inhibited by omega-agatoxin IVA, an antagonist of P/Q calcium 
      channels. Omega-conotoxin GVIA, which inhibits N type calcium channels did not 
      decrease significantly the entry of calcium or exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in 
      depolarized synaptosomes. 4. It is concluded that Tx3-3 potently inhibits 
      omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive calcium channels, which are involved in controlling 
      exocytosis in rat brain cortical synaptosomes.

TI  - Antiallodynic effect and side effects of Phα1β, a neurotoxin from the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer: comparison with ω-conotoxin MVIIA and morphine.
PG  - 626-33
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.09.008 [doi]
AB  - Phα1β is a potent toxin obtained from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer that blocks 
      neuronal voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels. This study compared the antiallodynic 
      effects of Phα1β, ω-conotoxin MVIIA and morphine in mice and their side effects in 
      rats. Mechanical allodynia was measured in mice receiving single intrathecal 
      administration of Phα1β, ω-conotoxin MVIIA or morphine before or after the 
      incisional plantar procedure. The effect of the treatments on cardiovascular profile 
      and global neurological were evaluated in rats. The expression of pro or 
      anti-inflammatory cytokines of human polymorph mononuclear cells was also evaluated. 
      Preemptive use of ω-conotoxin MVIIA (1.0 or 10 pmol/site) or morphine 
      (1000 pmol/site) induced shorter antiallodynic effect than Phα1β (100 pmol/site) in 
      mice. Post-incision administration of Phα1β (200 pmol/site) induced longer 
      mechanical antiallodynic effect than ω-conotoxin MVIIA (1.0 or 10 pmol/site) or 
      morphine (1000 pmol/site). Intrathecal injection of Phα1β (200 pmol/site) and 
      morphine (433 pmol/site) did not change while ω-conotoxin MVIIA (100 pmol/site) 
      increased the heart rate in rats 3 h after its administration. Phα1β 
      (200 pmol/site), ω-conotoxin MVIIA (100 pmol/site) and morphine (433 pmol/site) did 
      not change mean arterial pressure 0.5 and 3 h after their administration. The 
      treatments did not alter neurological performance assessed by global neurological 
      evaluation and open-field test. The tested drugs did not induced expression of pro 
      or anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD4 monocytes. In conclusion, preemptive 
      administration Phα1β in mice induced longer antiallodynic effect than ω-conotoxin 
      MVIIA and morphine. Phα1β also induced a longer mechanical antiallodynic effect than 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA and morphine when used after the surgical incision. The present 
      results suggest that Phα1β has a potential application in the management of 
      postoperative pain with low side effects.

TI  - Rat cortical synaptosomes have more than one mechanism for Ca2+ entry linked to 
      rapid glutamate release: studies using the Phoneutria nigriventer toxin PhTX2 and 
      potassium depolarization.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - PhTX2, one of the components of the venom of the South American spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, inhibits the closure of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. Incubation of 
      cerebral-cortical synaptosomes with PhTX2 causes a rapid increase in the 
      intrasynaptosomal free Ca2+ concentration and a dose-dependent release of glutamate. 
      This release is made up of a slow component, which appears to be due to reversal of 
      Na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake, and more rapid component that is dependent on the 
      entry of extrasynaptosomal Ca2+. It has previously been shown that membrane 
      depolarization using KCl can cause rapid Ca(2+)-dependent release of glutamate from 
      synaptosomes. This requires Ca2+ entry through a specific type of Ca2+ channel that 
      is sensitive to Aga-GI, a toxic component of the venom of the spider Agelenopsis 
      aperta. We have compared the effects of PhTX2 and KCl on elevation of 
      intrasynaptosomal free Ca2+ and glutamate release, and a number of differences have 
      emerged. Firstly, PhTX2-mediated Ca2+ influx and glutamate release, but not those 
      caused by KCl, are inhibited by tetrodotoxin. Secondly, KCl produces a clear 
      additional increase in Ca2+ and glutamate release following those elicited by PhTX2. 
      Finally, 500 microM MnCl2 abolishes PhTX2-mediated, but not KCl-mediated, glutamate 
      release. These findings suggest that more than one mechanism of Ca2+ entry may be 
      coupled to glutamate release from nerve endings.

TI  - Biochemical and pharmacological studies on a lethal neurotoxic polypeptide from 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom.
PG  - 879-83
AB  - Fractionation of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom by gel filtration and HPLC 
      yielded a few fractions that induced different effects when administered 
      intraperitoneally in mice. One of these fractions, PF3, was chemically characterized 
      as a cysteine-rich polypeptide of approximately 8360 MW. Administered at 0.1 mg/kg, 
      i.p., PF3 induced a progressive paralysis and death of mice within 30 minutes. 
      Partial sequence analysis of PF3 revealed certain homologies with other spider 
      toxins already described, particularly omega-AGAIIA (60%) from Agelenopsis aperta. 
      Pharmacological characterization carried out in superfused chopped rat striatal 
      tissues preloaded with [3H]-Dopamine ([3H]-DA) showed that PF3 (0.1 microgram/ml) 
      decreased the [3H]-DA release induced by 20 mM K+ or 100 microM glutamate without 
      changing the basal release. At 1 microgram/ml, PF3 inhibited 33% of the basal 
      release of [3H]-DA; the transmitter release stimulated by K+ or by glutamate was 
      reduced by respectively, 87% and 77% of corresponding control values. PF3 (0.1 
      micrograms/ml) altered the dose-response curves of glutamate (1 microM-10 mM), by 
      reducing by 36% of its maximal effect. Naloxone (1 microM) did not influence the 
      effect of PF3. The results indicate that PF3 inhibits the [3H]-DA release induced by 
      membrane depolarization or that mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors. These data 
      suggest that the mechanism of action of PF3 may involve a blockade of Ca2+ channels 
      as well as a direct effect on the exocytotic machinery.

TI  - Cloning of cDNAS encoding neurotoxic peptides from the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer.
PG  - 1843-50
AB  - A cDNA library made from venom glands of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer was 
      constructed and used to clone neurotoxic peptides. A cDNA of about 360 nucleotides 
      encoding the precursor for the toxin Tx2-1 active on mammals has been isolated. The 
      deduced amino acid sequence for the mature polypeptide confirms the polypeptide 
      sequence previously published. In addition, two new putative toxins called Pn2-1A 
      and Pn2-5A have been characterized and their complete amino acid sequence show 92% 
      similarity to Tx2-1 and 94% similarity to Tx2-5 respectively. The cDNAs revealed 
      that the precursors contain signal peptides characterized by a very hydrophobic core 
      and a propeptide interposed between the signal sequence and the peptide toxin.

PG  - 219-23
AB  - A cDNA with 403 nucleotides encoding the precursor of the toxin PnTx2-6 was cloned 
      and sequenced. Subsequent analysis revealed that the precursor begins with a signal 
      peptide and a glutamate-rich propeptide. The succeeding peptide confirmed the 
      reported sequence of PnTx2-6. The purified toxin exerted complex effects on Na(+) 
      current of frog skeletal muscle. There was a marked decrease of the inactivation 
      kinetics, and a shift to hyperpolarizing potentials of both the Na(+) conductance 
      and the steady-state inactivation voltage dependences, along with a reduction of the 
      current amplitude. The concentration dependence of the modified current suggests a 
      K(D) of 0.8 microM for the toxin-channel complex.

TI  - Toxins as tools in the study of sodium channel distribution in the muscle fibre 
      membrane.
PG  - 1085-98
AB  - The number of tetrodotoxin molecules bound to the membrane of the fibres of muscles 
      in normal conditions and after detubulation produced by glycerol-induced osmotic 
      shock pointed to a higher sodium channel density at the surface membrane than at the 
      membrane in the transverse tubules. Study of the maximum rate of rise of the action 
      potential at the junctional and nonjunctional regions of the muscle fibre membrane 
      suggested that the Na+ channel density is also not the same along the muscle fibre 
      membrane, being higher at the junctional region. Further studies on the distribution 
      of the Na+ channel along the muscle fibre membrane were carried out with the use of 
      (1) the loose patch voltage-clamp technique, (2) labelling the Na+ channels with 
      fluorescently labelled scorpion toxins, (3) autoradiography of localized Na+ 
      channels with 125I-labelled scorpion toxins, and (4) toxins that induce persistent 
      activation of the Na+ channel. The studies referred to in (1), (2) and (3) 
      demonstrate that the density of the Na+ channel is much higher at the junctional 
      region than elsewhere in the membrane of the muscle fibre. On the other hand, in 
      experiments carried out on curarized rat diaphragms several sodium channel 
      activating toxins (crotamine, Phoneutria nigriventer venom, its toxin PhTx2, 
      veratrine) were found to produce a much greater depolarization of the membrane at 
      the junctional region than at nonjunctional regions. However, it was also found that 
      some toxins (veratridine, batrachotoxin) depolarized equally well the junctional and 
      nonjunctional regions. Two alternative hypotheses to explain the uniform 
      depolarization of the muscle fibre membrane induced by these toxins are suggested.

TI  - Insect-selective spider toxins targeting voltage-gated sodium channels.
PG  - 490-512
AB  - The voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channel is a target for a number of drugs, 
      insecticides and neurotoxins. These bind to at least seven identified neurotoxin 
      binding sites and either block conductance or modulate Na(v) channel gating. A 
      number of peptide neurotoxins from the venoms of araneomorph and mygalomorph spiders 
      have been isolated and characterized and determined to interact with several of 
      these sites. These all conform to an 'inhibitor cystine-knot' motif with structural, 
      but not sequence homology, to a variety of other spider and marine snail toxins. Of 
      these, spider toxins several show phyla-specificity and are being considered as lead 
      compounds for the development of biopesticides. Hainantoxin-I appears to target 
      site-1 to block Na(v) channel conductance. Magi 2 and Tx4(6-1) slow Na(v) channel 
      inactivation via an interaction with site-3. The delta-palutoxins, and most likely 
      mu-agatoxins and curtatoxins, target site-4. However, their action is complex with 
      the mu-agatoxins causing a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of 
      activation, an action analogous to scorpion beta-toxins, but with both 
      delta-palutoxins and mu-agatoxins slowing Na(v) channel inactivation, a site-3-like 
      action. In addition, several other spider neurotoxins, such as delta-atracotoxins, 
      are known to target both insect and vertebrate Na(v) channels most likely as a 
      result of the conserved structures within domains of voltage-gated ion channels 
      across phyla. These toxins may provide tools to establish the molecular determinants 
      of invertebrate selectivity. These studies are being greatly assisted by the 
      determination of the pharmacophore of these toxins, but without precise 
      identification of their binding site and mode of action their potential in the above 
      areas remains underdeveloped.

PG  - 907-18
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.05.026 [doi]
AB  - PnTx3-4 is a toxin isolated from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer that 
      blocks N-, P/Q-, and R-type voltage-gated calcium channels and has great potential 
      for clinical applications. In this report we used the SUMO system to express large 
      amounts of recombinant PnTx3-4 peptide, which was found in both soluble and 
      insoluble fractions of bacterial extracts. We purified the recombinant toxin from 
      both fractions and showed that the recombinant peptide showed biological activity 
      similar to the native PnTx3-4. In silico analysis of the primary sequence of PnTx3-4 
      indicated that the peptide conforms to all the criteria of a knottin scaffold. 
      Additionally, circular dichroism spectrum analysis of the recombinant PnTx3-4 
      predicted that the toxin structure is composed of approximately 53% turns/unordered, 
      31% α-helix and 16% β-strand, which is consistent with predicted model of the 
      PnTx3-4 knottin scaffold available at the knottin database 
      (http://knottin.cbs.cnrs.fr). These studies provide the basis for future large scale 
      production and structure-function investigation of PnTx3-4.

TI  - Inhibition of glutamate uptake by a polypeptide toxin (phoneutriatoxin 3-4) from the 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer.
PG  - 413-8
AB  - Glutamate concentration increases significantly in the extracellular compartment 
      during brain ischaemia and anoxia. This increase has an important Ca(2+)-independent 
      component, which is due in part to the reversal of glutamate transporters of the 
      plasma membrane of neurons and glia. The toxin phoneutriatoxin 3-4 (Tx3-4) from the 
      spider Phoneutria nigriventer has been reported to decrease the evoked glutamate 
      release from synaptosomes by inhibiting Ca(2+) entry via voltage-dependent Ca(2+) 
      channels. However, we report here that Tx3-4 is also able to inhibit the uptake of 
      glutamate by synaptosomes in a time-dependent manner and that this inhibition in 
      turn leads to a decrease in the Ca(2+)-independent release of glutamate. No other 
      polypeptide toxin so far described has this effect. Our results suggest that Tx3-4 
      can be a valuable tool in the investigation of function and dysfunction of 
      glutamatergic neurotransmission in diseases such as ischaemia.

TI  - The Peptide PnPP-19, a Spider Toxin Derivative, Activates μ-Opioid Receptors and 
      Modulates Calcium Channels.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10010043 [doi]
LID - 43
AB  - The synthetic peptide PnPP-19 comprehends 19 amino acid residues and it represents 
      part of the primary structure of the toxin δ-CNTX-Pn1c (PnTx2-6), isolated from the 
      venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer. Behavioural tests suggest that PnPP-19 
      induces antinociception by activation of CB1, μ and δ opioid receptors. Since the 
      peripheral and central antinociception induced by PnPP-19 involves opioid 
      activation, the aim of this work was to identify whether this synthetic peptide 
      could directly activate opioid receptors and investigate the subtype selectivity for 
      μ-, δ- and/or κ-opioid receptors. Furthermore, we also studied the modulation of 
      calcium influx driven by PnPP-19 in dorsal root ganglion neurons, and analyzed 
      whether this modulation was opioid-mediated. PnPP-19 selectively activates μ-opioid 
      receptors inducing indirectly inhibition of calcium channels and hereby impairing 
      calcium influx in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Interestingly, notwithstanding 
      the activation of opioid receptors, PnPP-19 does not induce β-arrestin2 recruitment. 
      PnPP-19 is the first spider toxin derivative that, among opioid receptors, 
      selectively activates μ-opioid receptors. The lack of β-arrestin2 recruitment 
      highlights its potential for the design of new improved opioid agonists.

TI  - Isobolographic analysis reveals antinociceptive synergism between Phα1β recombinant 
      toxin and morphine in a model of cancer pain in C57BL/6J mice.
PG  - e20210027
LID - 10.1590/1678-9199-JVATITD-2021-0027 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phoneutria nigriventer venom contains Phα1β. This toxin and its 
      recombinant form have a remarkable analgesic potential that is associated with 
      blockage of voltage-gated calcium channels and TRPA1 receptors. Although morphine is 
      a mainstay drug to treat moderate and severe pain related to cancer, it has serious 
      and dose-limiting side effects. Combining recombinant Phα1β and morphine to treat 
      pain is an interesting approach that has been gaining attention. Therefore, a 
      quantitative and reliable method to establish the strength of the antinociceptive 
      interaction between these two substances is necessary. The present study was 
      designed to investigate the nature of the functional antinociceptive (analgesic) 
      interaction between Phα1β recombinant toxin and morphine in a model of cancer pain. 
      METHODS: Melanoma was produced by intraplantar inoculation of B16-F10 cells into the 
      right paw of C57BL/6J mice. Von Frey filaments measured the paw-withdrawal threshold 
      after intrathecal administration of morphine, recombinant Phα1β, and their 
      combination. Thermal hyperalgesia was assessed using Hargreaves apparatus. The 
      degree of interaction was evaluated using isobolographic analysis. Spontaneous and 
      forced motor performance was assessed with the open-field and rotarod tests, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Co-administration of recombinant Phα1β and morphine 
      synergistically reverses the melanoma-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. The potency 
      of the mixture, measured as the effective dose to reach 50% of maximum possible 
      effect (MPE) in ameliorating mechanical hyperalgesia, was about twice fold higher 
      than expected if the interaction between morphine and recombinant Phα1β was merely 
      additive. Treatment with the combination at doses necessary to reach 50% of MPE 
      caused no spontaneous nor forced motor alterations. CONCLUSION: The combinatorial 
      use of recombinant Phα1β and morphine allows significant and effective dose 
      reduction of both agents, which has translational potential for opioid-sparing 
      approaches in pain management related to cancer.

TI  - Spider venom components decrease glioblastoma cell migration and invasion through 
      RhoA-ROCK and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase β2: potential molecular entities to treat invasive 
      brain cancer.
PG  - 576

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GB) cells have the ability to migrate and infiltrate the 
      normal parenchyma, leading to the formation of recurrent tumors often adjacent to 
      the surgical extraction site. We recently showed that Phoneutria nigriventer spider 
      venom (PnV) has anticancer effects mainly on the migration of human GB cell lines 
      (NG97 and U-251). The present work aimed to investigate the effects of isolated 
      components from the venom on migration, invasiveness, morphology and adhesion of GB 
      cells, also evaluating RhoA-ROCK signaling and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase β2 (AMOG) 
      involvement. METHODS: Human (NG97) GB cells were treated with twelve subfractions 
      (SFs-obtained by HPLC from PnV). Migration and invasion were evaluated by scratch 
      wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Cell morphology and actin 
      cytoskeleton were shown by GFAP and phalloidin labeling. The assay with fibronectin 
      coated well plate was made to evaluate cell adhesion. Western blotting demonstrated 
      ROCK and AMOG levels and a ROCK inhibitor was used to verify the involvement of this 
      pathway. Values were analyzed by the GraphPad Prism software package and the level 
      of significance was determinate using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed 
      by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. RESULTS: Two (SF1 and SF11) of twelve SFs, 
      decreased migration and invasion compared to untreated control cells. Both SFs also 
      altered actin cytoskeleton, changed cell morphology and reduced adhesion. SF1 and 
      SF11 increased ROCK expression and the inhibition of this protein abolished the 
      effects of both subfractions on migration, morphology and adhesion (but not on 
      invasion). SF11 also increased Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase β2. CONCLUSION: All components of 
      the venom were evaluated and two SFs were able to impair human glioblastoma cells. 
      The RhoA effector, ROCK, was shown to be involved in the mechanisms of both PnV 
      components. It is possible that AMOG mediates the effect of SF11 on the invasion. 
      Further investigations to isolate and biochemically characterize the molecules are 
      underway.

AB  - Opioids are the first-line treatment for cancer pain. Incomplete pain relief and the 
      high rate of adverse effects of these compounds bring a need to combine them with 
      other drugs acting on different targets. AIMS: We here evaluate the antinociceptive 
      interaction and adverse events of methadone combined with recombinant Phα1β, an 
      analgesic toxin from Phoneutria nigriventer. MAIN METHODS: Melanoma was produced by 
      intraplantar inoculation of B16-F10 cells into the right paw. von Frey filaments 
      measured the paw-withdrawal threshold after administration of methadone, Phα1β, and 
      their combination. The degree of interaction was evaluated using isobolographic 
      analysis. Spontaneous performance and forced motor performance were assessed with 
      the open-field and rotarod tests, respectively. Intestinal function was evaluated by 
      the distance traveled by charcoal and opioid tolerance was induced by daily morphine 
      injections. KEY FINDINGS: Co-administration of Phα1β with methadone synergistically 
      reverses the melanoma-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. No motor alterations were 
      observed but mild alterations on intestinal function after treatment with the 
      combination that was also capable of restoring morphine analgesia in the tail-flick 
      test after an opioid-induced tolerance. SIGNIFICANCE: Combinatorial treatment with 
      Phα1β and methadone produces synergistic analgesic potentiation with potential 
      implications to pain treatment even under opioid tolerance conditions.

TI  - PnPP-19 Peptide Restores Erectile Function in Hypertensive and Diabetic Animals 
      Through Intravenous and Topical Administration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With the aim of overcoming the high toxicity of PnTx2-6 (or 
      δ-CNTX-Pn2a), a toxin from the venom of the armed spider (Phoneutria nigriventer), 
      the 19-aminoacid peptide, PnPP-19 (P nigriventer potentiator peptide), was 
      synthesized based on molecular modeling studies of PnTx2-6. PnPP-19 improved the 
      erectile function of normotensive rats and mice, without eliciting side effects, and 
      no signs of toxicity were observed. In addition, PnPP-19 was able to potentiate the 
      effect of sildenafil. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of PnPP-19 in hypertensive and 
      diabetic mouse/rat models in restoring erectile function, after topical 
      administration; verify the biodistribution of PnPP-19 administration (topical and 
      intravenous), permeation, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/nitric oxide via 
      implication. METHODS: Corpus cavernosum relaxation was evaluated using cavernous 
      strips from male spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and from streptozotocin 
      (STZ)-diabetic mice contracted with phenylephrine and submitted to electrical field 
      stimulation before and after incubation with PnPP-19 (10(-8) mol/L, 10 minutes) or 
      vehicle. This procedure was also used to determine cGMP/nitric oxide levels, at 8 Hz 
      and to check the effect of PnPP-19 with sildenafil citrate. Biodistribution assays 
      were performed using iodine 123-radiolabeled PnPP-19. In vivo erectile function was 
      evaluated using intracavernosal pressure/main arterial pressure ratio in 
      STZ-diabetic rats after PnPP-19 topical administration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      PnPP-19 may become a new drug able to fill the gap in the pharmacologic treatment of 
      erectile dysfunction, especially for hypertensive and diabetic individuals RESULTS: 
      PnPP-19 potentiated corpus cavernosum relaxation, in both control and SHR rats. 
      SHR-cavernosal tissue treated with PnPP-19 (1-32 Hz) reached the same relaxation 
      levels as control Wistar rats (16 and 32 Hz). PnPP-19 treatment improved cavernosal 
      tissue relaxation in STZ-diabetic mice and rats. PnPP-19 enhanced cGMP levels in 
      STZ-diabetic mice corpus cavernosum strips. After topical or intravenous 
      administration in rats, (123)I-PnPP-19 was mainly recruited to the penis. When 
      topically administered (400 μg/rat), PnPP-19 restores erectile function in 
      STZ-diabetic rats, also improving it in healthy rats by increasing the 
      intracavernosal pressure/main arterial pressure ratio. PnPP-19 exhibited an additive 
      effect when co-administered with sildenafil, showing a novel mode of action 
      regardless of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: PnPP-19 
      seems to be an indicated drug to be tested to treat ED in diabetic and hypertensive 
      patients. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: PnPP-19, although active by topical application 
      and showing safety to human beings (not shown), has low permeability, about 10% of 
      the applied dose. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that PnPP-19 may emerge as a potent 
      new drug that can be topically administered, becoming a promising alternative for 
      erectile dysfunction treatment. Nunes da Silva C, Pedrosa Nunes K, De Marco Almeida

TI  - [Considerations on locomotion activity, preference of ecotopes and territorial 
      aspects of Phoneutria nigriventer (Keyserling, 1891), (Araneae, Ctenidae)].
PG  - 71-8
AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer causes serious accidents in the south and southeastern 
      regions of Brazil and several authors have contributed to the knowledge of its 
      venom. The bionomics works on P. nigriventer have been done in the State of São 
      Paulo (also in Uruguay) and they carry, almost exclusively, laboratory observations. 
      This work was done in environmental conditions in Barra Mansa, south of Rio de 
      Janeiro State, Brazil, having field and laboratory observations. Thus, it provides 
      data on territorial behavior and preference of ecotopes of these arachnids in the 
      region. The methodology used consisted in capture-mark-recapture of youngs and 
      adults samples in field. For the conclusions concerning change of ecotopes only the 
      recaptures were considered. The marked individuals that were not recaptured in the 
      determined refuge where there were other youngs, were not considered dispersed 
      because they are in constant molts. The results revealed the following: 1. In 
      laboratory, the spiderlings performed cannibalism after the second ecdyse extra egg 
      sacs and the considerable increase of this index, which probably determines 
      dispersion, occurs from the fifth to the sixth week after emerging of egg sacs; 2. 
      Synanthropic habits of the species in the region; 3. Preference for living on the 
      ground instead of trees and other high places; 4. The youngs are much more active 
      than the adults and expose themselves more often to unsheltered places. The adult 
      females do not usually move more than 2 meters away from their shelter, and usually 
      come back at night, while the youngs move away in a larger radius and do not always 
      come back to the shelter.

      inhibitors.
PG  - 3693-3703
LID - 10.1096/fj.201801909R [doi]
AB  - A 13 aa residue voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channel inhibitor peptide, Pn, 
      containing 2 disulfide bridges was designed by using a chimeric approach. This 
      approach was based on a common pharmacophore deduced from sequence and secondary 
      structural homology of 2 Na(V) inhibitors: Conus kinoshitai toxin IIIA, a 14 residue 
      cone snail peptide with 3 disulfide bonds, and Phoneutria nigriventer toxin 1, a 78 
      residue spider toxin with 7 disulfide bonds. As with the parent peptides, this novel 
      Na(V) channel inhibitor was active on Na(V)1.2. Through the generation of 3 series 
      of peptide mutants, we investigated the role of key residues and cyclization and 
      their influence on Na(V) inhibition and subtype selectivity. Cyclic PnCS1, a 10 
      residue peptide cyclized via a disulfide bond, exhibited increased inhibitory 
      activity toward therapeutically relevant Na(V) channel subtypes, including Na(V)1.7 
      and Na(V)1.9, while displaying remarkable serum stability. These peptides represent 
      the first and the smallest cyclic peptide Na(V) modulators to date and are promising 
      templates for the development of toxin-based therapeutic agents.-Peigneur, S.,

AB  - Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) contains ion channels-acting neuropeptides 
      that in rat induces transitory blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb) in hippocampus 
      in parallel with VEGF upregulation. We investigated whether VEGF has a 
      neuroprotective role by inhibiting its binding to receptor Flk-1 by itraconazole 
      (ITZ). FT-IR spectroscopy examined the biochemical status of hippocampus and 
      evaluated BBBb in rats administered PNV or ITZ/PNV at periods with greatest toxicity 
      (1-2h), recovery (5h) and visual absence of symptoms (24h), and compared to saline 
      and ITZ controls. The antifungal treatment before venom intoxication aggravated the 
      venom effects and increased BBB damage. FT-IR spectra of venom, hippocampi of 
      controls, PNV and ITZ-PNV showed a 1400 cm(-1) band linked to symmetric stretch of 
      carboxylate and 1467 cm(-1) band (CH(2) bending: mainly lipids) that were considered 
      biomarker and reference bands, respectively. Inhibition of VEGF/Flk-1 binding 
      produced marked changes in lipid/protein stability at 1-2h. The largest differences 
      were observed in spectra regions assigned to lipids, both symmetric (2852 cm(-1)) 
      and asymmetric (2924 and 2968 cm(-1)). Quantitative analyses showed greatest 
      increases in the 1400 cm(-1)/1467 cm(-1) ratio also at 1h. Such changes at period of 
      rats' severe intoxication referred to wavenumber region from 3106 cm(-1) to 
      687 cm(-1) assigning for C-H and N-H stretching of protein, Amide I, C=N cytosine, 
      N-H adenine, Amide II, CH(2) bending: mainly lipids, C-O stretch: glycogen, 
      polysaccharides, glycolipids, z-type DNA, C-C, C-O and CH out-of-plane bending 
      vibrations. We conclude that VEGF has a neuroprotective role and can be a 
      therapeutic target in PNV envenomation. FT-IR spectroscopy showed to be instrumental 
      for monitoring biochemical changes in this model of P. nigriventer venom-induced BBB 
      disruption.

AB  - Native Phα1β is a peptide purified from the venom of the armed spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer that has been shown to have an extensive analgesic effect with fewer 
      side effects than ω-conotoxin MVIIA. Recombinant Phα1β mimics the effects of the 
      native Phα1β. Because of this, it has been suggested that Phα1β may have potential 
      to be used as a therapeutic for controlling persistent pathological pain. The amino 
      acid sequence of Phα1β is known; however, the exact structure and disulfide 
      arrangement has yet to be determined. Determination of the disulfide linkages and 
      exact structure could greatly assist in pharmacological analysis and determination 
      of why this peptide is such an effective analgesic. Here, we used biochemical and 
      mass spectrometry approaches to determine the disulfide linkages present in the 
      recombinant Phα1β peptide. Using a combination of MALDI-MS, direct infusion ESI-MS, 
      and nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of the undigested recombinant Phα1β peptide and digested 
      with AspN, trypsin, or AspN/trypsin, we were able to identify and confirm all six 
      disulfide linkages present in the peptide as Cys1-2, Cys3-4, Cys5-6, Cys7-8, 
      Cys9-10, and Cys11-12. These results were also partially confirmed in the native 
      Phα1β peptide. These experiments provide essential structural information about 
      Phα1β and may assist in providing insight into the peptide's analgesic effect with 
      very low side effects. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.

AB  - Short-chain insecticidal neurotoxin Tx4(6-1) from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer 
      can be prepared by reversed-phase high-performance liquid-chromatography (HPLC) 
      fractionation of PhTx4, but this is difficult and represents an obstacle preventing 
      analyses of its insecticidal activity against agricultural insect pests. Herein, we 
      performed secretory expression of recombinant Tx4(6-1) using Pichia pastoris strain 
      X33 as the host, and screened transformants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA). In flasks, ∼5 mg/l rTx4(6-1) was expressed as a secreted protein following 
      induction with methanol, and this was increased to 45 mg/l rTx4(6-1) in a fed-batch 
      reactor. Approximately 4 mg of high-purity rTx4(6-1) was purified from a 400 ml 
      fed-batch culture supernatant by Ni(+)-nitriloacetic acid affinity chromatography, 
      followed by carboxymethyl (CM) sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. Purified 
      rTx4(6-1) was determined by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, revealing a molecular 
      weight (MW) of 7660.5 Da, larger than the expected size due to O-linked 
      glycosylation. Insect bioactivity tests of rTx4(6-1)-treated fifth-instar silkworm 
      larvae (Bombyx mori Linnaeus) showed neurotoxin symptoms such as contraction 
      paralysis, abdominal contraction, and mouth movement syndrome, with a half lethal 
      dose at 12 h post-injection of ∼4.5-8.5 μg/g body weight. Dietary toxicity was not 
      observed in silkworm larvae.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of intravenous (iv) administration of 
      recombinant Phα1β toxin, pregabalin, and diclofenac by the intrathecal route using 
      an animal model fibromyalgia (FM). The reserpine administration (0.25 mg/kg s. c) 
      once daily for three consecutive days significantly induced hyperalgesia, immobility 
      time, and sucrose consumption in mice on the 4th day. Reserpine caused hyperalgesia 
      on the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia on the 4th day was reverted by 
      recombinant Phα1β (0.2 mg/kg iv) and pregabalin (1.25 μmol/site i. t) treatments. In 
      contrast, diclofenac (215 nmol/site i. t) was ineffective. Recombinant Phα1β toxin, 
      pregabalin, and diclofenac did not affect the depressive-like behavioural effect 
      induced by reserpine on mice during the forced swim and sucrose consumption tests. 
      The data confirmed the analgesic effect of the recombinant Phα1β toxin administered 
      intravenously in a fibromyalgia mouse model.

TI  - The peptide Phα1β, from spider venom, acts as a TRPA1 channel antagonist with 
      antinociceptive effects in mice.
PG  - 57-69
LID - 10.1111/bph.13652 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Peptides from venomous animals have long been important for 
      understanding pain mechanisms and for the discovery of pain treatments. Here, we 
      hypothesized that Phα1β, a peptide from the venom of the armed spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, produces analgesia by blocking the TRPA1 channel. EXPERIMENTAL 
      APPROACH: Cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, human fetal lung 
      fibroblasts (IMR90) or HEK293 cells expressing the human TRPA1 (hTRPA1-HEK293), 
      human TRPV1 (hTRPV1-HEK293) or human TRPV4 channels (hTRPV4-HEK293), were used for 
      calcium imaging and electrophysiology. Nociceptive responses induced by TRPA1, TRPV1 
      or TRPV4 agonists or by bortezomib were investigated in mice. KEY RESULTS: Phα1β 
      selectively inhibited calcium responses and currents evoked by the TRPA1 agonist, 
      allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), on hTRPA1-HEK293, IMR90 fibroblasts and DRG neurons. 
      Phα1β did not affect calcium responses evoked by selective TRPV1 (capsaicin) or 
      TRPV4 (GSK 1016790A) agonists on the various cell types. Intrathecal (i.t.) and 
      intraplantar (i.pl.) administration of low doses of Phα1β (up to 300 pmol per paw) 
      attenuated acute nociception and mechanical and cold hyperalgesia evoked by AITC 
      (i.t. or i.pl.), without affecting responses produced by capsaicin or hypotonic 
      solution. Notably, Phα1β abated the TRPA1-dependent neuropathic pain-like responses 
      induced by bortezomib. In vitro and in vivo inhibition of TRPA1 by Phα1β was 
      reproduced by a recombinant form of the peptide, CTK 01512-2. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Phα1β and CTK 01512-2 selectively target TRPA1, but not other TRP 
      channels. This specific action underlines the potential of Phα1β and CTK 01512-2 for 
      pain treatment.

AB  - The venom of the Brazilian armed spider Phoneutria nigriventer is a rich source of 
      biologically active peptides that have potential as analgesic drugs. In this study, 
      we investigated the analgesic and adverse effects of peptide 3-5 (Tx3-5), purified 
      from P. nigriventer venom, in several mouse models of pain. Tx3-5 was administered 
      by intrathecal injection to mice selected as models of postoperative (plantar 
      incision), neuropathic (partial sciatic nerve ligation) and cancer-related pain 
      (inoculation with melanoma cells) in animals that were either sensitive or tolerant 
      to morphine. Intrathecal administration of Tx3-5 (3-300 fmol/site) in mice could 
      either prevent or reverse postoperative nociception, with a 50 % inhibitory dose 
      (ID50) of 16.6 (3.2-87.2) fmol/site and a maximum inhibition of 87 ± 10 % at a dose 
      of 30 fmol/site. Its effect was prevented by the selective activator of L-type 
      calcium channel Bay-K8644 (10 μg/site). Tx3-5 (30 fmol/site) also produced a partial 
      antinociceptive effect in a neuropathic pain model (inhibition of 67 ± 10 %). 
      Additionally, treatment with Tx3-5 (30 fmol/site) nearly abolished cancer-related 
      nociception with similar efficacy in both morphine-sensitive and morphine-tolerant 
      mice (96 ± 7 and 100 % inhibition, respectively). Notably, Tx3-5 did not produce 
      visible adverse effects at doses that produced antinociception and presented a TD50 
      of 1125 (893-1418) fmol/site. Finally, Tx3-5 did not alter the normal mechanical or 
      thermal sensitivity of the animals or cause immunogenicity. Our results suggest that 
      Tx3-5 is a strong drug candidate for the treatment of painful conditions.

TI  - Characterization of the mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response to Polistes 
      lanio lanio (paper wasp) venom in mouse dorsal skin.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.10.006 [doi]
AB  - Stings by Polistes wasps can cause life-threatening allergic reactions, pain and 
      inflammation. We examined the changes in microvascular permeability and neutrophil 
      influx caused by the venom of Polistes lanio a paper wasp found in southeastern 
      Brazil. The intradermal injection of wasp venom caused long-lasting paw oedema and 
      dose-dependently increased microvascular permeability in mouse dorsal skin. 
      SR140333, an NK(1) receptor antagonist, markedly inhibited the response, but the 
      NK(2) receptor antagonist SR48968 was ineffective. The oedema was reduced in 
      capsaicin-treated rats, indicating a direct activation of sensory fibres. Dialysis 
      of the venom partially reduced the oedema and the remaining response was further 
      inhibited by SR140333. Mass spectrometric analysis of the venom revealed two 
      peptides (QPPTPPEHRFPGLM and ASEPTALGLPRIFPGLM) with sequence similarities to the 
      C-terminal region of tachykinin-like peptides found in Phoneutria nigriventer spider 
      venom and vertebrates. Wasp venom failed to release histamine from mast cells in 
      vitro and spectrofluorometric assay of the venom revealed a negligible content of 
      histamine in the usual dose of P. l. lanio venom (1nmol of histamine/7mug of venom) 
      that was removed by dialysis. The histamine H(1) receptor antagonist pyrilamine, but 
      not bradykinin B(1) or B(2) receptor antagonists, inhibited venom-induced oedema. In 
      conclusion, P. l. lanio venom induces potent oedema and increases vascular 
      permeability in mice, primarily through activation of tachykinin NK(1) receptors by 
      substance P released from sensory C fibres, which in turn releases histamine from 
      dermal mast cells. This is the first description of a neurovascular mechanism for P. 
      l. lanio venom-mediated inflammation. The extent to which the two tachykinin-like 
      peptides identified here contribute to this neurogenic inflammatory response remains 
      to be elucidated.

TI  - PhKv a toxin isolated from the spider venom induces antinociception by inhibition of 
      cholinesterase activating cholinergic system.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cholinergic agents cause antinociception by mimicking the 
      release of acetylcholine (ACh) from spinal cholinergic nerves. PhKv is a peptide 
      isolated from the venom of the armed spider Phoneutria nigriventer. It has an 
      antiarrythmogenic activity that involves the enhanced release of acetylcholine. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate whether PhKv had an antinociceptive action in 
      mice. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice (25-35g) were used in this study. The PhKv 
      toxin was purified from a PhTx3 fraction of the Phoneutria nigriventer spider's 
      venom. Because of its peptide nature, PhKv is not orally available and it was 
      delivered directly into the central nervous system by an intrathecal (i.t.) route. 
      PhKV on the thermal and mechanical sensitivity was evaluated using plantar test 
      apparatus and the up-and-down method. The analgesic effects of PhKv were studied in 
      neuropathic pain (CCI) and in the peripheral capsicin test. In order to test whether 
      PhKv interfered with the cholinergic system, the mice were pre-treated with atropine 
      (5mg/kg, i.p.) or mecamylamine (0.001mg/kg, i.p.) and the PhKv toxin (30pmol/site 
      i.t.) or neostigmine (100pmol/site) were applied 15min before the intraplantar 
      capsaicin (1nmol/paw) administrations. To investigate PhKv action on the AChE 
      activities, was performed in vitro and ex vivo assay for AChE. For the in vitro 
      experiments, mice spinal cord supernatants of tissue homogenates (1mg/ml) were used 
      as source of AChE activity. The AChE assay was monitored at 37°C for 10min in a 
      FlexStation 3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) at 405nm. RESULTS: 
      PhKv (30 and 100pmol/site, i.t.) had no effect on the thermal or mechanical 
      sensitivity thresholds. However, in a chronic constriction injury model of pain, 
      PhKv (10pmol/site, i.t.) caused a robust reduction in mechanical withdrawal with an 
      antinociceptive effect that lasted 4h. A pretreatment in mice with PhKv 
      (30pmol/site, i.t.) or neostigmine (100pmol/site, i.t.) 15min before an intraplantar 
      injection of capsaicin (1nmol/paw) caused a maximal antinociceptive effect of 
      69.5±4.9% and 85±2.5%, respectively. A pretreatment in mice with atropine; 5mg/kg, 
      i.p. or mecamylamine 0.001mg/kg, i.p. inhibited a neostigimine and PhKv-induced 
      antinociception, suggesting a cholinergic mechanism. Spinal acetylcholinesterase was 
      inhibited by PhKv with ED(50) of 7.6 (4.6-12.6pmol/site, i.t.). PhKv also inhibited 
      the in vitro AChE activity of spinal cord homogenates with an EC(50) of 20.8 
      (11.6-37.3nM), shifting the Km value from 0.06mM to 18.5mM, characterizing a 
      competitive inhibition of AChE activity by PhKv. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide, 
      to our knowledge, the first evidence that PhKv caused inhibition of AChE, it 
      increased the ACh content at the neuronal synapses, leading to an activation of the 
      cholinergic system and an antinociceptive response. IMPLICATIONS: Studies regarding 
      the nociceptive mechanisms and the identification of potential targets for the 
      treatment of pain have become top priorities. PhKv, by its action of stimulating the 
      cholinergic receptors muscarinic and nicotinic system, reduces pain it may be an 
      alternative for controlling the pain processes.

TI  - Effects of a toxic fraction, PhTx2, from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer on the 
      sodium current.
PG  - 205-8
AB  - The toxic fraction PhTx2 of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer was studied with a 
      modified loose patch clamp technique on frog skeletal muscle. At saturating 
      concentration (8 micrograms/ml) potassium currents were unaffected whereas there was 
      a 7-fold increase in the time constant of sodium current inactivation (at -13 mV 
      test potential). The time course of tail current deactivation was at least 3-fold 
      slower than the control. The steady state (100 ms) inactivation and the conductance 
      activation were shifted toward more negative potentials by 12.2 and 7.0 mV, 
      respectively. The reversal of the sodium current was shifted 7.6 mV to more negative 
      potential. We conclude that PhTx2 prolongs the inactivation and deactivation 
      processes of sodium ion channels. These effects may account for the toxicity of 
      PhTx2.

      opioid and cannabinoid systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some peptides purified from the venom of the spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer have been identified as potential sources of drugs for pain treatment. 
      In this study, we characterized the antinociceptive effect of the peptide PnPP-19 on 
      the central nervous system and investigated the possible involvement of opioid and 
      cannabinoid systems in its action mechanism. METHODS: Nociceptive threshold to 
      thermal stimulation was measured according to the tail-flick test in Swiss mice. All 
      drugs were administered by the intracerebroventricular route. RESULTS: PnPP-19 
      induced central antinociception in mice in the doses of 0.5 and 1 μg. The 
      non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (2.5 and 5 μg), μ-opioid receptor 
      antagonist clocinnamox (2 and 4 μg), δ-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (6 and 
      12 μg) and CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251 (2 and 4 μg) partially inhibited the 
      antinociceptive effect of PnPP-19 (1 μg). Additionally, the anandamide amidase 
      inhibitor MAFP (0.2 μg), the anandamide uptake inhibitor VDM11 (4 μg) and the 
      aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin (20 μg) significantly enhanced the antinociception 
      induced by a low dose of PnPP-19 (0.5 μg). In contrast, the κ-opioid receptor 
      antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (10 μg and 20 μg) and the CB(2) receptor antagonist 
      AM630 (2 and 4 μg) do not appear to be involved in this effect. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PnPP-19-induced central antinociception involves the activation of CB(1) 
      cannabinoid, μ- and δ-opioid receptors. Mobilization of endogenous opioids and 
      cannabinoids might be required for the activation of those receptors, since 
      inhibitors of endogenous substances potentiate the effect of PnPP-19. Our results 
      contribute to elucidating the action of the peptide PnPP-19 in the antinociceptive 
      pathway.

AB  - Based on degradation of sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes containing entrapped 
      horseradish peroxidase, we evaluated the Sphingomyelinase-D (SMase-D) activity of 
      scorpion, spider and snake venoms by monitoring spectrophotometrically the product 
      of oxidation of HRP released. The results indicate that Loxosceles crude venoms 
      (Loxosceles intermedia, Loxosceles laeta, Loxosceles gaucho and Loxosceles similis) 
      displayed SMase-D activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, this 
      activity was blocked by the anti-loxoscelic antivenom. However, Tityus serrulatus 
      scorpion venom, Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom and Bothrops jararaca, Crotalus 
      durissus, Lachesis muta and Micrurus frontalis snake venoms did not show measurable 
      SMase-D activity.

AB  - Abnormal calcium influx and glutamatergic excitotoxicity have been extensively 
      associated with neuronal death in Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic movement 
      disorder. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this fatal condition. The 
      neurotoxin Phα1β has demonstrated therapeutic effects as a calcium channel blocker, 
      for example during pain control. However, little is known about its neuroprotective 
      effect in HD. Herein, we investigated if Phα1β is effective in inhibiting neuronal 
      cell death in the BACHD mouse model for HD. We performed intrastriatal injection of 
      Phα1β in WT and BACHD mice. No side effects or unusual behaviors were observed upon 
      Phα1β administration. Using three different motor behavior tests, we observed that 
      injection of the toxin in BACHD mice greatly improved the animals' motor-force as 
      seen in the Wire-hang test, and also the locomotor performance, according to the 
      Open field test. NeuN labeling for mature neuron detection revealed that Phα1β toxin 
      promoted neuronal preservation in the striatum and cortex, when injected locally. 
      Intrastriatal injection of Phα1β was not able to preserve neurons from the spinal 
      cord and also not revert muscle atrophy in BACHD mice. Finally, we observed that 
      Phα1β might, at least in part, exert its protective effect by decreasing 
      L-glutamate, measured in cerebrospinal fluid. Our data provide evidence of a novel 
      neuroprotector effect of Phα1β, paving a path for the development of new approaches 
      to treat HD motor symptoms.

AB  - In the current study, the putative cDNA for PnTx2-6 toxin of the Phoneutria 
      nigriventer spider venom was cloned and expressed as tioredoxin fusion protein in 
      the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified from the 
      bacterial extracts by combination of immobilized Ni-ion affinity and gel filtration 
      chromatographies. Then, it was cleaved by enterokinase and the generated recombinant 
      PnTx2-6 (rPnTx2-6) was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Likewise the native 
      toxin purified from the spider venom, rPnTx2-6 potentiates the erectile function 
      when injected in rats. This result indicates that the production of functional 
      recombinant PnTx2-6 might be an alternative to provide this basic and valuable tool 
      for study, as well as for further understanding such complex physiological system, 
      including its correlation with the central nervous system and local tissue factors.

TI  - Beneficial Effects of the Calcium Channel Blocker CTK 01512-2 in a Mouse Model of 
      Multiple Sclerosis.

AB  - Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a critical role in neuroinflammatory 
      diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). CTK 01512-2 is a recombinant version of 
      the peptide Phα1β derived from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, which inhibits 
      N-type VGCC/TRPA1-mediated calcium influx. We investigated the effects of this 
      molecule in the mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The 
      effects of CTK 01512-2 were compared to those displayed by ziconotide-a selective 
      N-type VGCC blocker clinically used for chronic pain-and fingolimod-a drug employed 
      for MS treatment. The intrathecal (i.t.) treatment with CTK 01512-2 displayed 
      beneficial effects, by preventing nociception, body weight loss, splenomegaly, 
      MS-like clinical and neurological scores, impaired motor coordination, and memory 
      deficits, with an efficacy comparable to that observed for ziconotide and 
      fingolimod. This molecule displayed a favorable profile on EAE-induced 
      neuroinflammatory changes, including inflammatory infiltrate, demyelination, 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine production, glial activation, and glucose metabolism in 
      the brain and spinal cord. The recovery of spatial memory, besides a reduction of 
      serum leptin levels, allied to central and peripheral elevation of the 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, was solely modulated by CTK 01512-2, dosed 
      intrathecally. The intravenous (i.v.) administration of CTK 01512-2 also reduced the 
      EAE-elicited MS-like symptoms, similarly to that seen in animals that received 
      fingolimod orally. Ziconotide lacked any significant effect when dosed by i.v. 
      route. Our results indicate that CTK 01512-2 greatly improved the neuroinflammatory 
      responses in a mouse model of MS, with a higher efficacy when compared to 
      ziconotide, pointing out this molecule as a promising adjuvant for MS management.

AB  - The article contains a brief review on the properties and classification of 
      voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and on the organic blockers of the different channel 
      types. The effects of peptide toxins from the venoms of Conus sp and of the spider 
      Agelenopsis aperta on high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are discussed. In 
      addition, we present preliminary data on a novel peptide toxin purified from the 
      venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, which is a powerful blocker of L- and 
      N-type Ca2+ channels.

TI  - Fluorometric assay using naphthylamide substrates for assessing novel venom 
      peptidase activities.
PG  - 1617-26
AB  - In the present study we examined the feasibility of using the fluorometry of 
      naphthylamine derivatives for revealing peptidase activities in venoms of the snakes 
      Bothrops jararaca, Bothrops alternatus, Bothrops atrox, Bothrops moojeni, Bothrops 
      insularis, Crotalus durissus terrificus and Bitis arietans, of the scorpions Tityus 
      serrulatus and Tityus bahiensis, and of the spiders Phoneutria nigriventer and 
      Loxosceles intermedia. Neutral aminopeptidase (APN) and prolyl-dipeptidyl 
      aminopeptidase IV (DPP IV) activities were presented in all snake venoms, with the 
      highest levels in B. alternatus. Although all examined peptidase activities showed 
      relatively low levels in arthropod venoms, basic aminopeptidase (APB) activity from 
      P. nigriventer venom was the exception. Compared to the other peptidase activities, 
      relatively high levels of acid aminopeptidase (APA) activity were restricted to B. 
      arietans venom. B. arietans also exhibited a prominent content of APB activity which 
      was lower in other venoms. Relatively low prolyl endopeptidase and proline 
      iminopeptidase activities were, respectively, detectable only in T. bahiensis and B. 
      insularis. Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase activity was undetectable in all venoms. All 
      examined peptidase activities were undetectable in T. serrulatus venom. In this 
      study, the specificities of a diverse array of peptidase activities from 
      representative venoms were demonstrated for the first time, with a description of 
      their distribution which may contribute to guiding further investigations. The 
      expressive difference between snake and arthropod venoms was indicated by APN and 
      DPP IV activities while APA and APB activities distinguished the venom of B. 
      arietans from those of Brazilian snakes. The data reflected the relatively uniform 
      qualitative distribution of the peptidase activities investigated, together with 
      their unequal quantitative distribution, indicating the evolutionary divergence in 
      the processing of peptides in these different venoms and/or the different abilities 
      of the venoms examined to hydrolyze different peptides during envenomation.

TI  - Antinociceptive effect of Brazilian armed spider venom toxin Tx3-3 in animal models 
      of neuropathic pain.
PG  - 2224-2232
LID - 10.1016/j.pain.2011.04.015 [doi]
AB  - Venoms peptides have produced exceptional sources for drug development to treat 
      pain. In this study we examined the antinociceptive and side effects of Tx3-3, a 
      peptide toxin isolated from Phoneutria nigriventer venom, which inhibits 
      high-voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), preferentially P/Q and R-type VDCC. 
      We tested the effects of Tx3-3 in animal models of nociceptive (tail-flick test), 
      neuropathic (partial sciatic nerve ligation and streptozotocin-induced diabetic 
      neuropathy), and inflammatory (intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant) pain. In the 
      tail-flick test, both intrathecal (i.t.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) 
      injection of Tx3-3 in mice caused a short-lasting effect (ED(50) and 95% confidence 
      intervals of 8.8 [4.1-18.8] and 3.7 [1.6-8.4] pmol/site for i.t. and i.c.v. 
      injection, respectively), without impairing motor functions, at least at doses 10-30 
      times higher than the effective dose. By comparison, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, a P/Q and 
      N-type VDCC blocker derived from Conus magus venom, caused significant motor 
      impairment at doses close to efficacious dose in tail flick test. Tx3-3 showed a 
      long-lasting antinociceptive effect in neuropathic pain models. Intrathecal 
      injection of Tx3-3 (30 pmol/site) decreased both mechanical allodynia produced by 
      sciatic nerve injury in mice and streptozotocin-induced allodynia in mice and rats. 
      On the other hand, i.t. injection of Tx3-3 did not alter inflammatory pain. Taken 
      together, our data show that Tx3-3 shows prevalent antinociceptive effects in the 
      neuropathic pain models and does not cause adverse motor effects at antinociceptive 
      efficacious doses, suggesting that this peptide toxin holds promise as a novel 
      therapeutic agent for the control of neuropathic pain. The Brazilian armed spider 
      Tx3-3, a new P/Q and R-type calcium channel blocker, effectively alleviates 
      allodynia in animal neuropathic pain models.

TI  - Phα1β toxin prevents capsaicin-induced nociceptive behavior and mechanical 
      hypersensitivity without acting on TRPV1 channels.
PG  - 237-46
LID - S0028-3908(13)00138-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.04.001 [doi]
AB  - Phα1β toxin is a peptide purified from the venom of the armed spider Phoneutria 
      nigriventer, with markedly antinociceptive action in models of acute and persistent 
      pain in rats. Similarly to ziconotide, its analgesic action is related to inhibition 
      of high voltage activated calcium channels with more selectivity for N-type. In this 
      study we evaluated the effect of Phα1β when injected peripherally or intrathecally 
      in a rat model of spontaneous pain induced by capsaicin. We also investigated the 
      effect of Phα1β on Ca²⁺ transients in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and 
      HEK293 cells expressing the TRPV1 receptor. Intraplantar or intrathecal administered 
      Phα1β reduced both nocifensive behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity induced by 
      capsaicin similarly to that observed with SB366791, a specific TRPV1 antagonist. 
      Peripheral nifedipine and mibefradil did also decrease nociceptive behavior induced 
      by intraplantar capsaicin. In contrast, ω-conotoxin MVIIA (a selective N-type Ca²⁺ 
      channel blocker) was effective only when administered intrathecally. Phα1β, MVIIA 
      and SB366791 inhibited, with similar potency, the capsaicin-induced Ca²⁺ transients 
      in DRG neurons. The simultaneous administration of Phα1β and SB366791 inhibited the 
      capsaicin-induced Ca²⁺ transients that were additive suggesting that they act 
      through different targets. Moreover, Phα1β did not inhibit capsaicin-activated 
      currents in patch-clamp recordings of HEK293 cells that expressed TRPV1 receptors. 
      Our results show that Phα1β may be effective as a therapeutic strategy for pain and 
      this effect is not related to the inhibition of TRPV1 receptors.

TI  - Inhibition of high voltage-activated calcium channels by spider toxin PnTx3-6.
PG  - 1370-7
AB  - Animal peptide toxins have become powerful tools to study structure-function 
      relationships and physiological roles of voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels. In the 
      present study, we investigated the effects of PnTx3-6, a neurotoxin purified from 
      the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer on cloned mammalian Ca(2+) channels 
      expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and endogenous Ca(2+) channels in N18 
      neuroblastoma cells. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements indicate that PnTx3-6 
      reversibly inhibited L-(alpha(1C)/Ca(v)1.2), N-(alpha(1B)/Ca(v)2.2), 
      P/Q-(alpha(1A)/Ca(v)2.1), and R-(alpha(1E)/Ca(v)2.3) type channels with varying 
      potency (alpha(1B) > alpha(1E) > alpha(1A) > alpha(1C)) and IC(50) values of 122, 
      136, 263, and 607 nM, respectively. Inhibition occurred without alteration of the 
      kinetics or the voltage dependence of the exogenously expressed Ca(2+) channels. In 
      N18 cells, PnTx3-6 exhibited highest potency against N-type 
      (conotoxin-GVIA-sensitive) current. In contrast to its effects on high 
      voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels subtypes, application of 1 microM PnTx3-6 did not 
      affect alpha(1G)/Ca(v)3.1 T-type Ca(2+) channels. Based on our study, we suggest 
      that PnTx3-6 acts as a omega-toxin that targets high voltage-activated Ca(2+) 
      channels, with a preference for the Ca(v)2 subfamily (N-, P/Q-, and R-types).

TI  - Regional brain c-fos activation associated with penile erection and other symptoms 
      induced by the spider toxin Tx2-6.
PG  - 202-8
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.05.019 [doi]
AB  - Brain areas expressing c-fos messenger RNA were mapped by quantitative in situ 
      hybridization after 1-2 h of intoxication with 10 μg/kg Tx2-6, a toxin obtained from 
      the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer. Relative to saline-treated controls, 
      brains from toxin-treated animals showed pronounced c-fos activation in many brain 
      areas, including the supraoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus of the 
      hypothalamus, the motor nucleus of the vagus, area postrema, paraventricular and 
      paratenial nuclei of the thalamus, locus coeruleus, central amydaloid nucleus and 
      the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The paraventricular hypothalamus and the 
      bed nucleus of the stria terminalis have been implicated in erectile function in 
      other studies. A possible role for central NO is considered. Acute stress also 
      activates many brain areas activated by Tx2-6 as well as with NOstimulated Fos 
      transcription. Brain areas that appear to be selectively activated by Tx2-6, include 
      the paratenial and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria 
      terminalis and the area postrema and the dorsal motor n. of vagus in the medulla. 
      However, direct injections of different doses of the toxin into the paraventricular 
      hypothalamic n. failed to induce penile erection, arguing against CNS involvement in 
      this particular effect.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of pharmacological spinal inhibition of 
      voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) in mouse pruritus. The epidural administration 
      of P/Q-type MVIIC or PhTx3.3, L-type verapamil, T-type NNC 55-0396 or R-type SNX-482 
      VGCC blockers failed to alter the scratching behavior caused by the 
      proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) activator trypsin, injected into the mouse 
      nape skin. Otherwise, trypsin-elicited pruritus was markedly reduced by the spinal 
      administration of preferential N-type VGCC inhibitors MVIIA and Phα1β. Time-course 
      experiments revealed that Conus magus-derived toxin MVIIA displayed significant 
      effects when dosed from 1h to 4h before trypsin, while the anti-pruritic effects of 
      Phα1β from Phoneutria nigriventer remained significant for up to 12h. In addition to 
      reducing trypsin-evoked itching, MVIIA or Phα1β also prevented the itching elicited 
      by intradermal (i.d.) injection of SLIGRL-NH2, compound 48/80 or chloroquine, 
      although they did not affect H2O2-induced scratching behavior. Furthermore, the 
      co-administration of MVIIA or Phα1β markedly inhibited the pruritus caused by the 
      spinal injection of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), but not morphine. Notably, the 
      epidural administration of MVIIA or Phα1β greatly prevented the chronic pruritus 
      allied to dry skin model. However, either tested toxin failed to alter the edema 
      formation or neutrophil influx caused by trypsin, whereas they significantly reduced 
      the c-Fos activation in laminas I, II and III of the spinal cord. Our data bring 
      novel evidence on itching transmission mechanisms, pointing out the therapeutic 
      relevance of N-type VGCC inhibitors to control refractory pruritus.

TI  - ELISA for the detection of toxic antigens in experimental and clinical envenoming by 
      Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom.
PG  - 1649-56
AB  - An ELISA was developed for identification of circulating toxic antigens from Tityus 
      serrulatus scorpion venom. The toxic fraction from the scorpion venom was purified 
      by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and immunoaffinity techniques were used for 
      identifying antibodies that reacted with this fraction. These antibodies were used 
      to develop a sandwich-type ELISA. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by 
      its capacity for identifying mice that were experimentally inoculated with T. 
      serrulatus venom from those inoculated with Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom, 
      Apis mellifera bee venom and Bothrops atrox, Crotalus durissus terrificus, Lachesis 
      muta muta and Micrurus frontalis snake venoms. Measurable absorbance signals were 
      obtained with 0.1 ng of venom per assay. The ELISA also detected antigens in the 
      sera of patients systemically envenomed by T. serrulatus. Therefore, this ELISA 
      could be a valuable tool for clinicians and epidemiologists, owing to its 
      sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - ELISA for the detection of venom antigens in experimental and clinical envenoming by

PG  - 563-9
AB  - Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were developed to detect antigens from 
      Loxosceles intermedia spider venom. Hyperimmune horse anti-Loxosceles intermedia 
      IgGs were prepared by immunoaffinity chromatography and used to set up a 
      sandwich-type ELISA. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by its capacity 
      to correctly discriminate the circulating antigens in mice that were experimentally 
      inoculated with L. intermedia venom from those inoculated with L. gaucho, L. laeta, 
      and Phoneutria nigriventer spider venoms, Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom and 
      Bothrops jararaca, Crotalus durissus terrificus, Lachesis muta muta and Micrurus 
      frontalis snake venoms. Measurable absorbance signals were obtained with 0.8 ng of 
      venom per assay. The ELISA also detected antigens in the sera of patients envenomed 
      by L. intermedia. Therefore, after standardization for clinical use this ELISA may 
      be a valuable tool for clinicians and epidemiologists.

AB  - Two astrocyte markers, the glial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), have been implicated in several physiological and 
      pathological conditions in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in 
      blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb). By color segmentation the immunoreactivity of 
      both proteins, we demonstrate that the expression of AQP4 and GFAP was increased in 
      the cerebellum of neonate (14-day-old, P14) and adult (8-week-old) rats administered 
      Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) known to cause perivascular edema, BBBb 
      and convulsion. In the cerebellum's gray matter, PNV produced a major response, 
      especially in the granular layer. Parallel increases in AQP4 and GFAP expression 
      occurred 24 h after envenomation in the white matter of P14 and in the molecular 
      layer of adults, as well as in the granular layer 2 h after envenomation. In the 
      Purkinje layer there was a tendency of increased AQP4, for both, neonates (5 h), and 
      adults (2 and 24 h). Moreover, PNV also provoked nonparallel upregulation of both 
      markers with prevalence of upregulation of AQP 4 for P14 rats, and GFAP for adults. 
      The major expression of both proteins was in the gray matter. The data indicates a 
      venom effect in water/electrolyte balance in the cerebellum and the participation of 
      AQP4 in these effects. Age-related and time-related regional differences probably 
      reflect specificity in AQP4 distribution in different astrocytic membrane domains as 
      well as its participation in K(+) buffering and neural activity. This study is the 
      first to associate astrocytic AQP4 expression and reactive gliosis in a model of BBB 
      permeability promoted by P. nigriventer venom. Our data provide compelling evidence 
      that AQP4 expression was increased in the cerebellum of rats administered PNV.

TI  - Structure and activity analysis of two spider toxins that alter sodium channel 
      inactivation kinetics.
PG  - 3078-88
LID - 10.1021/bi802158p [doi]
AB  - In this work, Phoneutria nigriventer toxins PnTx2-5 and PnTx2-6 were shown to 
      markedly delay the fast inactivation kinetics of neuronal-type sodium channels. 
      Furthermore, our data show that they have significant differences in their 
      interaction with the channel. PnTx2-6 has an affinity 6 times higher than that of 
      PnTx2-5, and its effects are not reversible within 10-15 min of washing. PnTx2-6 
      partially (59%) competes with the scorpion alpha-toxin AaHII, but not with the 
      scorpion beta-toxin CssIV, thus suggesting a mode of action similar to that of site 
      3 toxins. However, PnTx2-6 is not removed by strong depolarizing pulses, as in the 
      known site 3 toxins. We have also established the correct PnTx2-5 amino acid 
      sequence and confirmed the sequence of PnTx2-6, in both cases establishing that the 
      cysteines are in their oxidized form. A structural model of each toxin is proposed. 
      They show structures with poor alpha-helix content. The model is supported by 
      experimental and theoretical tests. A likely binding region on PnTx2-5 and PnTx2-6 
      is proposed on the basis of their different affinities and sequence differences.

AB  - Agents that modulate the activity of high-voltage gated calcium channels (HVCCs) 
      exhibit experimentally and clinically significant effect by relieving visceral pain. 
      Among these agents, the toxins Phα1β and ω-conotoxin MVIIA effectively reduce 
      chronic pain in rodent models. The molecular mechanisms underlying the chronic pain 
      associated with acute pancreatitis (AP) are poorly understood. Hypercalcemia is a 
      risk factor; the role of cytosolic calcium is considered to be a modulator of 
      pancreatitis. Blockade of Ca(2+) signals may be useful as a prophylactic treatment 
      of pancreatitis. We explored the pathophysiological roles of three peptide toxins: 
      Phα1β and its recombinant form CTK 01512-2-blockers of TRPA1 receptor and HVCCs and 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a specific blocker of N-type calcium channels in cerulein-induced 
      AP. Cerulein injection elicits AP in rats, evidenced by an increase in hyperalgesic 
      pain, inflammatory infiltration, amylase and lipase secretion, and reactive oxygen 
      species, TNF-α, and p65 NF-κB levels. These effects of cerulein-induced AP were 
      abolished by Phα1β and its recombinant form CTK 01512-2, whereas ω-conotoxin MVIIA 
      had no effect on the induced increase in pancreatic enzyme secretion. Our results 
      demonstrate that Phα1β and CTK 01512-2 toxins-antagonists of HVCCs and TRPA1 
      receptor presented an effective response profile, in the control of nociception and 
      inflammatory process in the AP model in rats, without causing changes in spontaneous 
      locomotion of the rats.

TI  - Biological activities of a lectin from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Snake venoms contain saccharide-binding lectins. In this work, we examined the 
      biological activities of a lectin (BjcuL) purified from Bothrops jararacussu snake 
      venom by chromatography on non-derivatized Sepharose 4B and Sephacryl S-200 HR. The 
      protein, a homodimer with subunits of 14.5 kDa, gave a single immunoprecipitin line 
      in immunoelectrophoresis and cross-reacted in ELISA with antivenoms raised against 
      Bothrops spp. (lanceheads), Micrurus spp. (coral snakes), Crotalus durissus 
      terrificus (South American rattlesnake), and arthropod (Loxosceles gaucho, 
      Phoneutria nigriventer and Tityus serrulatus) venoms. BjcuL agglutinated human 
      formaldehyde-fixed erythrocytes at > or = 100 ng/ml and was inhibited by lactose and 
      EDTA (> or = 2 mM) and high concentrations (> 100 mM) of glucose and sucrose, but 
      not by N-acetylglucosamine. BjcuL had no direct hemolytic activity and was devoid of 
      esterase, PLA2 and proteolytic activities. The lectin (up to 200 microg/ml) did not 
      aggregate human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or washed platelets (WP), nor did it 
      alter the aggregation induced by ADP in PRP or by thrombin in WP. When injected into 
      mouse hind paws, BjcuL (10-100 microg/paw) caused edema and increased vascular 
      permeability, with a maximum effect after 1h that persisted for up to 6 h (edema) or 
      gradually decreased after the peak interval (vascular permeability). No hemorrhage 
      was observed in BjcuL-injected paws. In anesthetized rats, B. jararacussu venom (200 
      microg/kg, i.v.) produced sustained hypotension (maximum decrease of approximately 
      60%) whereas a similar dose of BjcuL decreased the blood pressure by approximately 
      15%, with a rapid return to the resting level.

      induced by implantation of GL261 mouse cells. PhTx3-3, Phα1β and MVIIA displayed 
      significant inhibitory effects on the proliferation and viability of all tested 
      glioma cell lines, and evoked cell death mainly with apoptosis characteristics, as 
      indicated by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) positivity. The antiproliferative 
      effects of toxins were confirmed by flow cytometry using Ki67 staining. None of the 
      tested toxins altered the proliferation rates of the N9 non-tumor glial cell line. 
      Noteworthy, the administration of the preferential N-type VGCC inhibitors, Phα1β (50 
      pmol/site; i.c.v.), its recombinant form CTK 01512-2 (50 pmol/site; i.c.v. and 
      i.t.), or MVIIA (10 pmol/site; i.c.v.) caused significant reductions of tumor areas 
      in vivo. N-type VGCC inhibition by Phα1β, CTK 01512-2, and MVIIA led to a marked 
      increase of GFAP-activated astrocytes, and Iba-1-positive microglia, in the 
      peritumoral region, which might explain, at least in part, the inhibitory effects of 
      the toxins in tumor development. This study provides novel evidence on the potential 
      effects of P. nigriventer-derived P/Q-, and mainly, N-type VGCC inhibitors, in 
      glioma progression.

LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.12.004 [doi]
AB  - Venoms from the bee Apis mellifera, the caterpillar Lonomia achelous, the spiders 
      Lycosa sp. and Phoneutria nigriventer, the scorpions Tityus bahiensis and Tityus 
      serrulatus, and the snakes Bothrops alternatus, Bothrops jararaca, Bothrops 
      jararacussu, Bothrops moojeni, Bothrops neuwiedi, Crotalus durissus terrificus, and 
      Lachesis muta were assayed (800mug/mL) for activity against Staphylococcus aureus. 
      Venoms from B. jararaca and B. jararacussu showed the highest S. aureus growth 
      inhibition and also against other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To 
      characterize the microbicidal component(s) produced by B. jararaca, venom was 
      fractionated through gel exclusion chromatography. The high molecular weight, 
      anti-S. aureus P1 fraction was further resolved by anion exchange chromatography 
      through Mono Q columns using a 0-0.5M NaCl gradient. Bactericidal Mono Q fractions 
      P5 and P6 showed significant LAAO activity using l-leucine as substrate. These 
      fractions were pooled and subjected to Heparin affinity chromatography, which 
      rendered a single LAAO activity peak. The anti-S. aureus activity was abolished by 
      catalase, suggesting that the effect is dependent on H(2)O(2) production. SDS-PAGE 
      of isolated LAAO indicated the presence of three isoforms since deglycosylation with 
      a recombinant N-glycanase rendered a single 38.2 kDa component. B. jararaca LAAO 
      specific activity was 142.7 U/mg, based on the oxidation of l-leucine. The 
      correlation between in vivo neutralization of lethal toxicity (ED(50)) and levels of 
      horse therapeutic antibodies anti-LAAO measured by ELISA was investigated to predict 
      the potency of Brazilian antibothropic antivenoms. Six horses were hyperimmunized 
      with Bothrops venoms (50% from B. jararaca and 12.5% each from B. alternatus, B. 
      jararacussu, B. neuwiedii and B. moojeni). To set up an indirect ELISA, B. jararaca 
      LAAO and crude venom were used as antigens. Correlation coefficients (r) between 
      ED(50) and ELISA antibody titers against B. jararaca venom and LAAO were 0.846 
      (p<0.001) and 0.747 (p<0.001), respectively. The hemolytic and leishmanicidal 
      (anti-Leishmania amazonensis) activity of LAAO was also determined.

TI  - Analgesic effects of the CTK 01512-2 toxin in different models of orofacial pain in 
      rats.
PG  - 600-611
LID - 10.1007/s43440-020-00108-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial pain is clinically challenging, having therapeutic failures 
      and side effects. This study evaluated the antinociceptive activities of the CTK 
      01512-2 toxin, the TRPA1 channel antagonist, and the selective inhibitor of the 
      N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (N-type VGCC), in different pain models. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The trigeminal ganglia were stimulated in vitro with 
      capsaicin. The in vivo models received subcutaneous (sc) injections of formalin into 
      the upper lip of the rats, Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) into the 
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and infraorbital nerve constrictions (IONC). CTK 
      01512-2 at concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 pmol/site, intrathecally (ith), and 
      MVIIA at 10, 30, and 100 pmol/site in the formalin test, guided the doses for the 
      models. The glutamate levels in the CSF of the rats that were submitted to IONC were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: CTK 01512-2 decreased the nociceptive behavior in the 
      inflammatory phase of the formalin test (65.94 ± 7.35%) and MVIIA in the neurogenic 
      phase (81.23 ± 3.36%). CTK 01512-2 reduced facial grooming with FCA in the TMJ 
      (96.7 ± 1.6%), and in the IONC neuropathy model, it decreased heat hyperalgesia 
      (100%) and cold hyperalgesia (81.61 ± 9.02%). The levels of glutamate in the 
      trigeminal ganglia in vitro (81.40 ± 8.59%) and in the CSF in vivo (70.0 ± 9.2%) 
      were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The roles of TRPA1 in pain transduction and the 
      performance of CTK 01512-2 in the inhibition of the N-type VGCCs were reinforced. 
      This dual activity may represent an advantage in clinical treatments.

TI  - The inhibitory effect of Phα1β toxin on diabetic neuropathic pain involves the CXCR4 
      chemokine receptor.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1007/s43440-019-00002-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic neuropathy is a common cause of painful diabetic neuropathy 
      (PDN). C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression is increased in peripheral 
      nerve samples from diabetes patients, suggesting a role for CXCR4 in PDN. Therefore, 
      we evaluated the effects of Phα1β, ω-conotoxin MVIIA, and AMD3100 in a model of 
      streptozotocin (STZ)-induced PDN in rodents and naïve model of rats with the 
      activation of the CXCR4/stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) signal. METHODS: 
      Diabetic neuropathy was induced by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of STZ in Wistar 
      rats. Naïve rats were intrathecally injected with SDF-1 to test the CXCR4/SDF-1 
      signal. The effects of Phα1β intrathecal (it), ω-conotoxin MVIIA intrathecal (it), 
      and AMD3100 intraperitoneal (ip) on rat hypersensitivity, IL-6, and the 
      intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)](i) content of diabetic synaptosomes were studied. 
      RESULTS: The drugs reduced the hypersensitivity in diabetic rats. SDF-1 (1.0 µg/it) 
      administration in naïve rats induced hypersensitivity. Phα1β (100 pmol/it) or 
      AMD3100 (2.5 µg/ip) reduced this hypersensitivity after 2 h treatments, while 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA did not have an effect. IL-6 and [Ca(2+)](i) content increased in 
      the spinal cord synaptosomes in diabetic rats. The drug treatments reduced IL-6 and 
      the calcium influx in diabetic synaptosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Phα1β, ω-conotoxin MVIIA, 
      and AMD3100, after 2 h of treatment of STZ-induced PDN, reduced hypersensitivity in 
      diabetic rats. In naïve rats with CXCR4/SDF-1 activation, the induced 
      hypersensitivity decreased after 2 h treatments with Phα1β or AMD-3100, while 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA did not affect. The inhibitory effects of Phα1β on PDN may involve 
      voltage-dependent calcium channels.

TI  - PnTx3-6 a spider neurotoxin inhibits K+-evoked increase in [Ca2+](i) and 
      Ca2+-dependent glutamate release in synaptosomes.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - The present experiments investigated the effect of a neurotoxin purified from the 
      venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer. This toxic component, P. nigriventer 
      toxin 3-6 (PnTx3-6), abolished Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release with an IC(50) of 
      74.4nM but did not alter Ca(2+)-independent secretion of glutamate when brain 
      cortical synaptosomes were depolarized by KCl (33mM). This effect was most likely 
      due to interference with the entry of calcium through voltage activated calcium 
      channels (VACC), reducing the increase in the intrasynaptosomal free calcium induced 
      by membrane depolarization with an IC(50) of 9.5nM. We compared the alterations 
      induced by PnTx3-6 with the actions of toxins known to block calcium channels 
      coupled to exocytosis. Our results indicate that PnTx3-6 inhibition of glutamate 
      release and intrasynaptosomal calcium involves P/Q type calcium channels and this 
      toxin can be a valuable tool in the investigation of calcium channels.

TI  - Spinal blockage of P/Q- or N-type voltage-gated calcium channels modulates 
      functional and symptomatic changes related to haemorrhagic cystitis in mice.
PG  - 924-39
LID - 10.1111/bph.12966 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are pivotal 
      regulators of painful and inflammatory alterations, representing attractive 
      therapeutic targets. We examined the effects of epidural administration of the P/Q- 
      and N-type VGCC blockers Tx3-3 and Phα1β, respectively, isolated from the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, on symptomatic, inflammatory and functional changes allied 
      to mouse cyclophosphamide (CPA)-induced haemorrhagic cystitis (HC). The effects of 
      P. nigriventer-derived toxins were compared with those displayed by MVIIC and MVIIA, 
      extracted from the cone snail Conus magus. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HC was induced by 
      a single i.p. injection of CPA (300 mg·kg(-1) ). Dose- and time-related effects of 
      spinally administered P/Q and N-type VGCC blockers were assessed on nociceptive 
      behaviour and macroscopic inflammation elicited by CPA. The effects of toxins were 
      also evaluated on cell migration, cytokine production, oxidative stress, functional 
      cystometry alterations and TRPV1, TRPA1 and NK1 receptor mRNA expression. KEY 
      RESULTS: The spinal blockage of P/Q-type VGCC by Tx3-3 and MVIIC or N-type VGCC by 
      Phα1β attenuated nociceptive and inflammatory events associated with HC, including 
      bladder oxidative stress and cytokine production. CPA produced a slight increase in 
      bladder TRPV1 and TRPA1 mRNA expression, which was reversed by all the toxins 
      tested. Noteworthy, Phα1β strongly prevented bladder neutrophil migration, besides 
      HC-related functional alterations, and its effects were potentiated by co-injecting 
      the selective NK1 receptor antagonist CP-96345. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our 
      results shed new light on the role of spinal P/Q and N-type VGCC in bladder 
      dysfunctions, pointing out Phα1β as a promising alternative for treating 
      complications associated with CPA-induced HC.

TI  - Development and evaluation of the neutralizing capacity of horse antivenom against 
      the Brazilian spider Loxosceles intermedia.
PG  - 1323-8
AB  - Spider bites due to Loxosceles intermedia are currently a major public health 
      problem in South Brazil. About 3000 cases are reported annually. Specific treatment 
      for spider bites is provided by the polyvalent anti-arachnidic antiserum produced by 
      Butantan Institute, São Paulo, Brazil by immunizing horses with mixtures of venoms 
      from Tityus serrulatus and T. bahiensis scorpions, as well as Phoneutria nigriventer 
      and L. gaucho spiders. Due to the large amounts of the anti-arachnidic antivenom 
      required and since L. intermedia venom has some biochemical and pharmacological 
      variations, we have produced a specific anti-L. intermedia antivenom. This study 
      shows that horses immunized with crude L. intermedia venom produced IgG antibodies 
      that neutralized the dermonecrotic and lethal activities of the venom. The 
      neutralizing potency of the anti-loxoscelic antivenom was compared with that of the 
      anti-arachnidic antivenom. Our results indicate that both antivenoms were effective 
      in terms of neutralization. However, the anti-loxoscelic antivenom was more 
      efficient than the anti-arachnidic.

TI  - PhTx3-4, a Spider Toxin Calcium Channel Blocker, Reduces NMDA-Induced Injury of the 
      Retina.
LID - 10.3390/toxins8030070 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - The in vivo neuroprotective effect of PhTx3-4, a spider toxin N-P/Q calcium channel 
      blocker, was studied in a rat model of NMDA-induced injury of the retina. NMDA 
      (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)-induced retinal injury in rats reduced the b-wave amplitude 
      by 62% ± 3.6%, indicating the severity of the insult. PhTx3-4 treatment increased 
      the amplitude of the b-wave, which was almost equivalent to the control retinas that 
      were not submitted to injury. The PhTx3-4 functional protection of the retinas 
      recorded on the ERG also was observed in the neuroprotection of retinal cells. 
      NMDA-induced injury reduced live cells in the retina layers and the highest 
      reduction, 84%, was in the ganglion cell layer. Notably, PhTx3-4 treatment caused a 
      remarkable reduction of dead cells in the retina layers, and the highest 
      neuroprotective effect was in the ganglion cells layer. NMDA-induced cytotoxicity of 
      the retina increased the release of glutamate, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      production and oxidative stress. PhTx3-4 treatment reduced glutamate release, ROS 
      production and oxidative stress measured by malondialdehyde. Thus, we presented for 
      the first time evidence of in vivo neuroprotection from NMDA-induced retinal injury 
      by PhTx3-4 (-ctenitoxin-Pn3a), a spider toxin that blocks N-P/Q calcium channels.

TI  - Novel peptide toxins from acrorhagi, aggressive organs of the sea anemone Actinia 
      equina.
PG  - 768-74
AB  - Two peptide toxins, acrorhagin I (50 residues) and II (44 residues), were isolated 
      from special aggressive organs (acrorhagi) of the sea anemone Actinia equina by gel 
      filtration on Sephadex G-50 and reverse-phase HPLC on TSKgel ODS-120T. The LD50 
      against crabs of acrorhagin I and II were estimated to be 520 and 80 microg/kg, 
      respectively. 3'- and 5'-RACE established the amino acid sequences of the acrorhagin 
      precursors. The precursor of acrorhagin I is composed of both signal and mature 
      peptides and that of acrorhagin II has an additional sequence (propart) between 
      signal and mature peptides. Acrorhagin I has no sequence homologies with any toxins, 
      while acrorhagin II is somewhat similar to spider neurotoxins (hainantoxin-I from 
      Selenocosmia hainana and Tx 3-2 from Phoneutria nigriventer) and cone snail 
      neurotoxin (omega-conotoxin MVIIB from Conus magus). In addition, analogous peptides 
      (acrorhagin Ia and IIa) were also cloned during RT-PCR experiments performed to 
      confirm the nucleotide sequences of acrorhagins. This is the first to demonstrate 
      the existence of novel peptide toxins in the sea anemone acrorhagi.

TI  - Phα1β, a dual blocker of TRPA1 and Cav2.2, as an adjuvant drug in opioid therapy for 
      postoperative pain.

AB  - Opioids are the "gold standard" treatment for postoperative pain, but these drugs 
      also have limiting adverse effects. Thus, adjuvant drugs might be useful in opioid 
      therapy for postoperative pain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
      effect of Phα1β, a dual blocker of Cav2 and TRPA1 channels, on antinociceptive and 
      adverse actions of morphine in a model of postoperative pain. Phα1β (100-300 
      pmol/site) or morphine (3-10 mg/kg), alone, largely reduced postoperative 
      nociception. However, Phα1β (100 pmol/site) or morphine (10 mg/kg) also produced 
      motor impairment. Lower doses of Phα1β (30 pmol/site) or morphine (1 mg/kg), that 
      did not have an effect alone, showed antinociceptive effect when concomitantly 
      administrated. Moreover, co-administration of Phα1β (30 pmol/site) with morphine (1 
      or 10 mg/kg) was unable to cause motor impairment. Preoperative repeated treatment 
      with morphine increased the expression of Cav2 and TRPA1 channels in spinal cord, 
      and caused tolerance and withdrawal syndrome, which were reversed with a single 
      injection of Phα1β (30 pmol/site). When injected postoperatively, escalating doses 
      of morphine worsened postoperative hyperalgesia, induced tolerance, and withdrawal 
      syndrome. Similarly, Phα1β (30 pmol/site) reversed these adverse effects. Single or 
      repeated morphine caused constipation, which was not altered by Phα1β. Thus, a low 
      dose of Phα1β potentiated the analgesia, and reversed some adverse effects of 
      morphine on operated mice, indicating the potential use of this agent as an adjuvant 
      drug in opioid therapy for postoperative pain.

TI  - Inhibition of glutamate uptake by Tx3-4 is dependent on the redox state of cysteine 
      residues.
PG  - 2191-4
AB  - Glutamate transporters are essential for the homeostasis of glutamate and normal 
      function of glutamatergic synapses. Their function was shown to be regulated by 
      redox agents and dimerizations that involves redox changes of cysteine residues. 
      Peptide neurotoxins are also known to be rich in cysteine residues that contribute 
      to their activity and stability. Among them is the toxin Tx3-4, from the spider 
      Phoneutria nigriventer, which is able to inhibit glutamate uptake in rat hippocampal 
      synaptosomes. Based on results obtained with manipulation of the redox state of 
      cysteine residues in synaptosomes and in Tx3-4, we suggest that the effect of this 
      toxin on glutamate uptake is due to interactions that involve cysteines both in the 
      toxin and in the transporters.

TI  - The effect of PhTx3 on the release of 3H-acetylcholine induced by tityustoxin and 
      potassium in brain cortical slices and myenteric plexus.
PG  - 131-3
AB  - The venom of the Brazilian spider Phoneutria nigriventer possesses several 
      neurotoxic polypeptidic fractions. Previous work has established that one of the 
      toxic components, PhTx3, inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release and the 
      increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ in response to membrane depolarization. In the 
      present work, we investigated the effect of PhTx3 on the release of acetylcholine 
      (ACh) from brain and peripheral neurons. PhTx3 decreased the release of [3H]-ACh 
      induced by tityustoxin and KCl in brain cortical slices and myenteric plexus. The 
      inhibitory effect of myenteric plexus had the same magnitude as that obtained in the 
      absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, in brain PhTx3 was less efficient at 
      decreasing the evoked release of ACh. These experiments suggest that the target of 
      PhTx3 is coupled to the process of release of ACh in brain and autonomic nervous 
      system.

TI  - Morphological abnormalities in myelinated nerve fibres caused by Leiurus, 
      Centruroides and Phoneutria venoms and their prevention by tetrodotoxin.
PG  - 115-22
AB  - Morphological changes in peripheral nerve caused by the venoms of the scorpions 
      Leiurus quinquestriatus and Centruroides sculpturatus were compared with those 
      caused by Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom. Both scorpion venoms are known to 
      delay the inactivation of sodium currents, Centruroides venom also altering the 
      voltage dependence of sodium gating. Venom was injected by means of a glass 
      micropipette into the sciatic nerves of anaesthetized mice. After survival times 
      ranging from 15 min to 24 h the nerves were examined by light and electron 
      microscopy. The two scorpion venoms caused alterations virtually identical to those 
      produced by Phoneutria venom, which included swelling of the nodal axoplasm and 
      accumulation of fluid in the periaxonal space of myelinated fibres. These 
      alterations were most marked after 1 to 2 h and had largely disappeared by 24 h. 
      Pre-treatment of the nerves with tetrodotoxin, which specifically blocks sodium 
      channels, completely prevented both the nodal axoplasmic swelling and the periaxonal 
      oedema. It seems likely that these effects result from an action common to the three 
      venoms and that this is probably a delay in the inactivation of sodium current at 
      the node of Ranvier.

AB  - The treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel produces a painful 
      peripheral neuropathy, and is associated with an acute pain syndrome in a clinically 
      significant number of patients. However, no standard therapy has been established to 
      manage the acute pain or the chronic neuropathic pain related to paclitaxel. In the 
      present study, we evaluated the analgesic potential of two N-type voltage-gated 
      calcium channel (VGCC) blockers, ω-conotoxin MVIIA and Phα1β, on acute and chronic 
      pain induced by paclitaxel. Adult male rats were treated with four intraperitoneal 
      injections of paclitaxel (1+1+1+1mg/kg, in alternate days) and the development of 
      mechanical hyperalgesia was evaluated 24h (acute painful stage) or 15days (chronic 
      painful stage) after the first paclitaxel injection. Not all animals showed 
      mechanical hyperalgesia 24h after the first paclitaxel injection, but those that 
      showed developed a more intense mechanical hyperalgesia at the chronic painful 
      stage. Intrathecal administration (i.t.) of ω-conotoxin MVIIA (3-300pmol/site) or 
      Phα1β (10-300pmol/site) reduced the mechanical hyperalgesia either at the acute or 
      at the chronic painful stage induced by paclitaxel. When administered at the acute 
      painful stage, ω-conotoxin MVIIA (300pmol/site, i.t.) and Phα1β (300pmol/site, i.t.) 
      prevented the worsening of chronic mechanical hyperalgesia. Furthermore, Phα1β 
      (30-300pmol/site, i.t.) elicited less adverse effects than ω-conotoxin MVIIA (10-300 
      pmol/site, i.t.). Taken together, our data evidence the involvement of N-type VGCC 
      in pain sensitization induced by paclitaxel and point out the potential of Phα1β as 
      a safer alternative than ω-conotoxin MVIIA to treat the pain related to paclitaxel.

TI  - Spider peptide Phα1β induces analgesic effect in a model of cancer pain.
PG  - 1226-30
LID - 10.1111/cas.12209 [doi]
AB  - The marine snail peptide ziconotide (ω-conotoxin MVIIA) is used as an analgesic in 
      cancer patients refractory to opioids, but may induce severe adverse effects. Animal 
      venoms represent a rich source of novel drugs, so we investigated the analgesic 
      effects and the side-effects of spider peptide Phα1β in a model of cancer pain in 
      mice with or without tolerance to morphine analgesia. Cancer pain was induced by the 
      inoculation of melanoma B16-F10 cells into the hind paw of C57BL/6 mice. After 14 
      days, painful hypersensitivity was detected and Phα1β or ω-conotoxin MVIIA (10-100 
      pmol/site) was intrathecally injected to evaluate the development of antinociception 
      and side-effects in control and morphine-tolerant mice. The treatment with Phα1β or 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA fully reversed cancer-related painful hypersensitivity, with 
      long-lasting results, at effective doses 50% of 48 (32-72) or 33 (21-53) pmol/site, 
      respectively. Phα1β produced only mild adverse effects, whereas ω-conotoxin MVIIA 
      induced dose-related side-effects in mice at analgesic doses (estimated toxic dose 
      50% of 30 pmol/site). In addition, we observed that Phα1β was capable of controlling 
      cancer-related pain even in mice tolerant to morphine antinociception (100% of 
      inhibition) and was able to partially restore morphine analgesia in such animals (56 
      ± 5% of inhibition). In this study, Phα1β was as efficacious as ω-conotoxin MVIIA in 
      inducing analgesia in a model of cancer pain without producing severe adverse 
      effects or losing efficacy in opioid-tolerant mice, indicating that Phα1β has a good 
      profile for the treatment of cancer pain in patients.

TI  - Novel polypeptide toxins with crab lethality from the sea anemone Anemonia 
      erythraea.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - The sea anemone Anemonia erythraea was found to contain polypeptide toxins with crab 
      lethality as well as hemolysins. Three polypeptide toxins (AETX I, II and III) were 
      isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and reverse-phase HPLC on TSKgel 
      ODS-120T. A geographic variation in toxin composition was suggested. The LD50 
      against crabs of AETX I, II and III were estimated to be 2.2, 0.53 and 0.28 
      microg/kg, respectively, but none of the toxins showed lethality in mice. The amino 
      acid sequences of the three toxins were deduced from sequencings of the whole 
      molecules and their enzymatic fragments. Amino acid analyses and molecular mass 
      determinations supported the accuracy of the deduced sequences. AETX I, comprising 
      47 amino acid residues including 6 half-Cys residues, is an analog of sea anemone 
      type I toxins. On the other hand, AETX II and III, which are highly homologous with 
      each other, are quite distinct from the known sea anemone polypeptide toxins in that 
      they are composed of 59 residues including 10 half-Cys residues. Interestingly, both 
      toxins have sequence similarities with neurotoxins isolated from the Brazilian 
      'armed' spider Phoneutria nigriventer.

TI  - The synthetic peptide PnPP-19 induces peripheral antinociception via activation of 
      NO/cGMP/K(ATP) pathway: Role of eNOS and nNOS.
PG  - 31-38
LID - S1089-8603(16)30065-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.niox.2017.01.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: and purpose: The peptide PnPP-19, derived from the spider toxin PnTx2-6 
      (renamed as δ-CNTX-Pn1c), potentiates erectile function by activating the nitrergic 
      system. Since NO has been studied as an antinociceptive molecule and PnPP-19 is 
      known to induce peripheral antinociception, we intended to evaluate whether PnPP-19 
      could induce peripheral antinociception through activation of this pathway. 
      EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Nociceptive thresholds were measured by paw pressure test. 
      PGE(2) (2 μg/paw) was administered intraplantarly together with PnPP-19 and 
      inhibitors/blockers of NOS, guanylyl cyclase and K(ATP) channels. The nitrite 
      concentration was accessed by Griess test. The expression and phosphorylation of 
      eNOS and nNOS were determined by western blot. KEY RESULTS: PnPP-19 (5, 10 and 20 
      μg/paw) induced peripheral antinociception in rats. Administration of NOS inhibitor 
      (L-NOarg), selective nNOS inhibitor (L-NPA), guanylyl cyclase inhibitor (ODQ) and 
      the blocker of K(ATP) (glibenclamide) partially inhibited the antinociceptive effect 
      of PnPP-19 (10 μg/paw). Tissue nitrite concentration increased after PnPP-19 (10 
      μg/paw) administration. Expression of eNOS and nNOS remained the same in all tested 
      groups, however the phosphorylation of nNOS Ser852 (inactivation site) increased and 
      phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1177 (activation site) decreased after PGE(2) injection. 
      Administration of PnPP-19 reverted this PGE(2)-induced effect. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: The peripheral antinociceptive effect induced by PnPP-19 is resulting 
      from activation of NO-cGMP-K(ATP) pathway. Activation of eNOS and nNOS might be 
      required for such effect. Our results suggest PnPP-19 as a new drug candidate to 
      treat pain and reinforce the importance of nNOS and eNOS activation, as well as 
      endogenous NO release, for induction of peripheral antinociception.

AB  - AIMS: Extensive evidence supports a role for voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) 
      and TRPV1 receptors in pain transmission and modulation. We investigated the profile 
      of analgesic interaction between Phα1β toxin (a VGCC blocker) and SB366791 
      (selective TRPV1 antagonist) in a model of acute pain induced by capsaicin. Changes 
      in body temperature induced by combination regimens were also evaluated. MAIN 
      METHODS: Isobolographic approach with a fixed dose-ratio of combined drugs was used 
      to determine whether antinociceptive interaction of Phα1β and SB366791 are 
      subadditive, additive or synergic. Body temperature was obtained by thermal infrared 
      imaging. KEY FINDINGS: Phα1β and SB366791 interact in a synergistic manner to cause 
      antinociception. We found an interaction index (α) of 0.07 for Phα1β and SB366791 
      when these drugs were injected together intraplantarly, which indicates that in vivo 
      interaction between these drugs is greater than additive interaction. Synergism also 
      occurred when intraplantar SB366791 was administered simultaneously with intrathecal 
      Phα1β (interaction index α=0.06) suggesting a 15 fold rise in potency on the 
      analgesic effect of these drugs when they are added together. It was observed no 
      significant alterations in body temperature of animals treated with this combination 
      regimen. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data reveal that Phα1β toxin potentiates in 15 fold the 
      antinociceptive action of the TRPV1 blocker SB366791. Therefore, lower doses of 
      these drugs are required to achieve antinociceptive effects when these agents are 
      given in combination.

AB  - The effects of intrathecal administration of the toxins Phα1β and ω-conotoxin MVIIA 
      were investigated in visceral nociception induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 
      acetic acid and an intracolonic application of capsaicin. The pretreatments for 2h 
      with the toxins reduced the number of writhes or nociceptive behaviors compared with 
      the control mice. Phα1β administration resulted in an Imax of 84±6 and an ID50 of 12

      administration of Phα1β resulted in an Imax of 64±4 and an ID50 of 18 (9-38), and

      contortions induced by intracolonic capsaicin administration. Phα1β (100/site) or 
      ω-conotoxin MVIIA (30pmol/site) pretreatments caused a reduction in CSF glutamate 
      release in mice intraperitoneally injected with acetic acid or treated with 
      intracolonic capsaicin. The toxin pretreatments reduced the ROS levels induced by 
      intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. Phα1β, but not ω-conotoxin MVIIA, reduced 
      significantly the ROS levels induced by intracolonic capsaicin administration. 
      PERSPECTIVE: Phα1β is a ω-toxin with high therapeutic index and a broader action on 
      calcium channels. It shows analgesic effect in several rodents' models of pain, 
      including visceral pain, suggesting that this toxin has the potential to be used in 
      clinical setting as a drug in the control of persistent pathological pain.

TI  - Acute swelling of nodes of Ranvier caused by venoms which slow inactivation of 
      sodium channels.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - The venoms of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer and the scorpions Leiurus 
      quinquestriatus and Centruroides sculpturatus cause acute, transient swelling of 
      axons at nodes of Ranvier. The changes in the morphology of the node and paranode 
      were studied in the mouse. Venom was injected into the sciatic nerve by means of a 
      glass micropipette. After survival times ranging from 15 min to 3 weeks the nerves 
      were examined by light and electron microscopy. The increase in nodal axoplasmic 
      volume led within an hour to disruption of neurofilaments and microtubules, swelling 
      of the paranodes and displacement of the terminal loops of myelin away from the 
      node. Axonal calibre recovered within a few hours, but restoration of nodal width 
      took several days and seemed to be accomplished by elongation and remodelling of the 
      paranodal myelin. Occasional internodes were interrupted by node-like 
      discontinuities in the myelin sheath. These developed within a few hours and 
      persisted for the duration of the study.
